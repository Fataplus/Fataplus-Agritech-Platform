# Mobile App RAG Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities in the Fataplus mobile app to enable offline LLM functionality for Madagascar farmers with limited internet connectivity.

## Requirements
Based on the user's request, we need to implement:
1. Self-hosting local LLM capabilities
2. QR code-based peer-to-peer sharing
3. Hotspot connectivity between users
4. Chat traceability and logging
5. Offline functionality using SQLite for vector store persistence

## Technical Approach
We'll leverage the React Native RAG library (https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/react-native-rag) which provides:
- On-device LLM inference using ExecuTorch
- SQLite-based vector store persistence
- Modular architecture for RAG components

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Research and Setup
1. Analyze React Native RAG library capabilities
2. Identify suitable LLM models for agricultural use cases
3. Set up development environment with required dependencies

### Phase 2: Core RAG Implementation
1. Integrate React Native RAG into the mobile app
2. Implement offline LLM inference with ExecuTorch
3. Add SQLite vector store persistence using op-sqlite
4. Create basic chat interface for LLM interaction

### Phase 3: Peer-to-Peer Sharing
1. Implement QR code generation for local LLM sharing
2. Build hotspot connectivity functionality
3. Create interface for users to connect to technician's local LLM
4. Implement chat session management between connected users

### Phase 4: Chat Traceability
1. Add chat logging functionality
2. Implement local storage of conversation history
3. Create sync mechanism for chat logs when connectivity is available

### Phase 5: Optimization and Testing
1. Optimize for low-resource devices common in Madagascar
2. Test offline functionality in simulated environments
3. Validate peer-to-peer sharing and connectivity features
4. Performance testing under various network conditions

## Dependencies
- React Native RAG library
- ExecuTorch for on-device inference
- SQLite for vector store persistence
- QR code generation libraries
- Hotspot management capabilities

## Timeline
Estimated implementation time: 4-6 weeks
- Phase 1: 3-5 days
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 3-5 days
- Phase 5: 1 week

## Success Metrics
- Farmers can access AI assistance offline
- Peer-to-peer sharing works reliably
- Chat sessions are properly logged and traceable
- App performs well on low-resource devices
