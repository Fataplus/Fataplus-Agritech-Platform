# Fataplus Mobile App - Offline LLM Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds offline LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities to the Fataplus mobile app, specifically designed for farmers in Madagascar and other regions with limited internet connectivity. The solution enables peer-to-peer sharing of AI assistance through local hosting and QR code-based connections.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Offline LLM Inference
- **On-device Execution**: Using React Native RAG library with ExecuTorch for efficient local processing
- **No Internet Required**: Complete functionality without network connectivity
- **Resource Optimized**: Designed for low-end devices common in rural Africa

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Sharing
- **Local Hosting**: Technicians can host their local LLM as a service
- **QR Code Connection**: Simple visual method for farmers to connect to technician's AI
- **Hotspot Connectivity**: Uses WiFi hotspot technology for local network creation
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Enables sharing of agricultural expertise from technicians to farmers

### 3. Chat Traceability
- **Local Logging**: All conversations stored locally on device
- **Session Management**: Multiple conversation threads with history
- **Data Persistence**: Chat logs survive app restarts
- **Future Synchronization**: Architecture supports cloud sync when connectivity is available

## Technical Architecture

### Core Services
1. **RAG Service**: Manages the Retrieval-Augmented Generation system
2. **QR Service**: Handles QR code generation and parsing
3. **Network Service**: Manages peer-to-peer connectivity
4. **Chat Service**: Manages conversation history and persistence
