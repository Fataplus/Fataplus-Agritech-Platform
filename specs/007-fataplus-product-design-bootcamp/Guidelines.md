## üé® Design System Guidelines

### Agricultural Design Principles

#### Color System
```css
/* Primary Agricultural Palette */
--color-soil: #8B4513;        /* Rich earth brown */
--color-growth: #228B22;      /* Sustainable green */
--color-water: #1E90FF;       /* Clean water blue */
--color-sun: #FFD700;         /* Golden sunlight */
--color-harvest: #FF6347;     /* Harvest orange */

/* Semantic Colors */
--color-success: #10B981;     /* Successful crop growth */
--color-warning: #F59E0B;     /* Weather/seasonal warnings */
--color-error: #EF4444;       /* Failed crops/disease */
--color-info: #3B82F6;        /* Market information */
```

#### Typography Scale
- **Headings**: Use clear, readable fonts that work on low-resolution screens
- **Body Text**: 16px minimum for mobile readability
- **Agricultural Terms**: Bold important crop names, equipment, and processes
- **Numbers**: Always show units (kg, hectares, liters) clearly
- **Dates**: Use local formats (DD/MM/YYYY for most African contexts)

#### Layout Patterns
- **Farm Record Cards**: Standardized layout for crop/livestock information
- **Weather Dashboard**: Regional weather patterns with agricultural impact
- **Market Price Lists**: Commodity pricing with trend indicators
- **Input Calculator**: Seed, fertilizer, and equipment quantity calculators

```typescript
interface ButtonVariant {
  primary: {
    background: '--color-growth',
    text: 'white',
    use: 'Primary actions like "Save Harvest" or "Submit Order"'
  },
  secondary: {
    background: 'transparent',
    border: '--color-growth',
    text: '--color-growth',
    use: 'Secondary actions like "View Details" or "Cancel"'
  },
  warning: {
    background: '--color-harvest',
