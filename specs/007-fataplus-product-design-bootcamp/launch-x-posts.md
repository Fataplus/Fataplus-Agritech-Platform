# Launch X Posts - Fataplus Product Design Bootcamp

## Main Launch Post (Thread)

üå± **We're launching the Fataplus Product Design Bootcamp!**

The first specialized bootcamp teaching product design for African agricultural technology - with Figma at its core.

üßµ Here's why this matters:

1/ Africa has massive potential in agricultural technology but lacks skilled designers who understand both farming contexts and modern design tools.

2/ Our 12-week intensive program bridges this gap by teaching:
- Agricultural UX patterns
- Mobile-first design for rural connectivity
- Design systems for agri-tech
- Figma mastery from basics to advanced prototyping

3/ What makes us different:
‚úÖ Free for qualified students (pay-it-forward model)
‚úÖ Real agricultural projects with actual farming data
‚úÖ 70% job placement rate within 6 months
‚úÖ Taught by agricultural technology experts

4/ We're looking for:
- Agricultural professionals wanting to transition to design
- Tech entrepreneurs building farming solutions
- Students passionate about sustainable agriculture
- Anyone eager to design solutions that farmers actually want to use

5/ Applications open now for our first cohort starting in January 2024.
