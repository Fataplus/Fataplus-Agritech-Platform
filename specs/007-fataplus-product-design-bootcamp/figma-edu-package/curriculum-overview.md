# Curriculum Overview — Fataplus Product Design Bootcamp

## Program Summary
A 12-week intensive, mentor-led program focused on product design for agricultural technology in Africa. Figma is the core tool across research, UX, UI, prototyping, design systems, and developer handoff.

## How Figma Is Used
- Research synthesis boards and user flows
- Wireframes and responsive layouts (auto-layout, constraints)
- Component libraries and design tokens for agricultural UI
- High-fidelity UI and interactive prototypes (variants, smart animate)
- Accessibility annotations and multi-language variants
- Developer handoff (inspect, redlines, asset export)
- Real-time collaboration for team-based projects

## Modules
- Module 1 (3 weeks): Design Fundamentals + Figma Mastery
- Module 2 (2 weeks): Agricultural UX Patterns & Mobile Design
- Module 3 (4 weeks): Advanced Figma, Prototyping, Design Systems
- Module 4 (4 weeks): Capstone — End-to-end Figma-based project

## Learning Outcomes
- Figma proficiency (core + advanced)
- Agricultural UX patterns and accessibility
- Design systems and scalable component architecture
- Interactive prototypes ready for stakeholder testing
- Production-ready specs for engineering handoff

## Assessment
- Weekly exercises and critiques
- Midterm prototype review
- Final capstone presentation with working Figma prototype and system docs
