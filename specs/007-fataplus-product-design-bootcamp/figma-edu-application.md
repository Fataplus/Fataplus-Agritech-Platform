## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

**Anything else you'd like to share with us?**

**The Madagascar Reality - Why This Bootcamp Exists:**

Right now, as we speak, young Malagasy people are in the streets protesting. They're not asking for luxuries - they're demanding basic human rights that most of the world takes for granted: **electricity and clean water**. 

The government has failed to provide these fundamental infrastructure needs for generations. Without electricity, there are no factories, no offices, no traditional jobs. Without clean water, there are health crises and economic paralysis. This isn't just a development issue - it's a humanitarian crisis affecting millions of young people who want to work, contribute, and build a future.

**This is why Fanomezanirina Fenohery created Fataplus and this bootcamp.**

When you're 22 years old in Madagascar and the government tells you "there are no jobs" because they can't even provide basic electricity and water, what do you do? Do you accept a life of poverty and hopelessness? Or do you find another way?

**Our Response - Technology as Liberation:**

We realized that while the government controls physical infrastructure, they can't control the internet. While they fail to provide electricity, young people can access mobile data. While they can't create traditional jobs, we can teach skills that enable remote work with international companies.

**This bootcamp is our act of resistance against systemic failure.**

- **Electricity Independence**: We teach design skills that work on mobile devices, don't require constant power
- **Infrastructure Workarounds**: Offline-first design thinking, mobile optimization for unreliable connectivity
- **Global Opportunity**: Skills that enable remote work with companies in Europe, America, Asia - anywhere with better infrastructure
- **Economic Liberation**: When local government fails to create jobs, we create global economic opportunities

**The Protest Connection:**

Every student in our bootcamp is someone who could be in the streets protesting for basic rights. Instead, we're giving them something more powerful: **economic independence through technology skills**. 

When a graduate gets hired by a German company for remote design work, earning $500/month (which is life-changing in Madagascar), that's one less person dependent on a government that can't even provide electricity.

**Why Figma EDU is Revolutionary for Madagascar:**

- **Free Education**: When families can't afford traditional education, Figma EDU makes world-class design training accessible
- **Immediate Employment**: Figma skills are in global demand - graduates can start earning within months
- **Infrastructure Resilience**: Design work can continue even during power outages and water shortages
- **Hope**: Instead of protesting for basic rights, students are building skills that transcend those limitations

**Our Mission is Clear:**

We're not just running a design bootcamp. We're creating an alternative economy for Madagascar's youth - one that doesn't depend on government infrastructure that may never come. Every graduate represents a young person who has found a way to succeed despite systemic failures.

When the streets are filled with protesters demanding basic rights, we're in the classrooms teaching the skills that will make those protests unnecessary - because our students will have economic independence through technology.

This is why we need Figma EDU access. This is why this bootcamp matters. This is our response to a government that has failed its young people for decades.

**The youth are not just protesting - they're building alternatives. This bootcamp is one of those alternatives.**
