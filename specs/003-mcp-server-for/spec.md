# Feature Specification: MCP Server for Fataplus Design System

**Feature Branch**: `003-mcp-server-for`  
**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "MCP Server for Design System"

---

## Executive Summary

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for Fataplus Design System provides a standardized interface for AI models and development tools to interact with the design system programmatically. This server exposes design tokens, component definitions, usage guidelines, and cultural adaptations through a structured API that enables AI-powered design assistance, automated documentation generation, and intelligent component recommendations.

### Strategic Context
As the Fataplus Design System grows to serve diverse African agricultural contexts, an MCP server will:
- **Enable AI-powered design assistance** for developers and designers
- **Provide structured access** to design tokens, components, and guidelines
- **Support automated documentation** and code generation workflows
- **Facilitate intelligent recommendations** based on agricultural contexts and cultural needs
- **Integrate with development tools** for enhanced productivity

### Current State Analysis
The Fataplus project currently has:
- Established design system specification (Feature 002)
- UI component library in `/web-frontend/src/components/ui/`
- Design system showcase page at [`fataplus-design.tsx`](file:///Users/fefe/Documents/Documents%20-%20MacBook%20Pro%20de%20Fenohery/Fataplus-Cloudron%20R&D/FP-09/web-frontend/src/pages/fataplus-design.tsx)
- Tailwind CSS configuration with custom tokens
- TypeScript definitions for components

### Vision Statement
"Create an intelligent, AI-accessible interface to the Fataplus Design System that empowers developers, designers, and AI tools to build culturally-aware agricultural interfaces more efficiently and accurately."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Stories

#### AI-Powered Development Assistant Story
"As an AI development assistant helping to build agricultural interfaces, I want to access comprehensive design system information through a standardized protocol so that I can provide accurate component recommendations, generate culturally-appropriate code, and suggest accessibility improvements based on the specific agricultural context."

#### Frontend Developer Story
"As a frontend developer building agricultural applications, I want my IDE and AI tools to automatically suggest appropriate Fataplus components, design tokens, and patterns based on my current context so that I can build consistent interfaces faster without manually searching through documentation."

#### Design Tool Integration Story
"As a design tool (Figma plugin, VS Code extension), I want to programmatically access design tokens, component specifications, and cultural guidelines so that I can provide real-time validation, suggestions, and automated code generation aligned with Fataplus standards."

#### Agricultural Context Expert Story
"As an agricultural domain expert working with AI tools, I want the system to understand agricultural contexts (crops, livestock, seasons, regions) and provide relevant component recommendations so that interfaces accurately reflect farming practices and cultural considerations."

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Component Discovery and Recommendation
**Given** a developer is building a livestock management interface
**When** an AI tool queries the MCP server for relevant components
**Then** the server returns livestock-specific components (health cards, breeding trackers)
**And** includes usage guidelines for African livestock management contexts
**And** provides accessibility considerations for rural environments
**And** suggests appropriate design tokens for agricultural themes

#### Scenario 2: Cultural Adaptation Guidance
**Given** a designer is adapting interfaces for West African markets
**When** an AI tool requests cultural adaptation information
**Then** the server provides region-specific guidelines and color meanings
**And** recommends appropriate iconography for the target culture
**And** suggests text direction and typography adjustments
**And** includes examples of successful cultural adaptations

#### Scenario 3: Design Token Access and Validation
**Given** a development tool needs to validate design consistency
**When** it queries the MCP server for current design tokens
**Then** the server returns structured token information with semantic meanings
**And** includes agricultural context associations for each token
**And** provides validation rules for token usage
**And** includes accessibility compliance information

#### Scenario 4: Agricultural Context-Aware Suggestions
**Given** an AI assistant is helping build a crop management dashboard
**When** it requests components for "rice farming in Madagascar"
**Then** the server returns crop-specific components and patterns
**And** includes seasonal considerations for rice cultivation
**And** suggests appropriate data visualization components
**And** provides Malagasy cultural and linguistic adaptations

#### Scenario 5: Documentation Generation
**Given** an automated documentation tool needs to generate component guides
**When** it requests comprehensive component information
**Then** the server provides structured component metadata
**And** includes code examples for different agricultural contexts
**And** provides accessibility testing procedures
**And** includes cultural sensitivity guidelines

### Edge Cases

#### Multi-Context Queries
- How does the server handle requests for components spanning multiple agricultural contexts (e.g., crop and livestock management)?
- What happens when cultural adaptations conflict between different African regions?
- How are seasonal variations in component recommendations handled?

#### Performance and Caching
- How does the server maintain performance when serving multiple concurrent AI requests?
- What caching strategies ensure design token consistency across different tools?
- How are real-time updates to the design system propagated to connected clients?

#### Version Management
- How does the server handle requests for different design system versions?
- What happens when a component is deprecated or significantly changed?
- How are backward compatibility requirements managed?

#### Agricultural Domain Complexity
- How does the server handle requests for highly specific agricultural practices not covered in the standard component library?
- What happens when AI tools request components for agricultural contexts outside of Africa?
- How are emerging agricultural technologies and practices integrated into recommendations?
