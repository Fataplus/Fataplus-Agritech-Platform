# Tasks: Fataplus Agritech Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-fataplus-agritech-platform/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: tech stack (TypeScript, Python, Go), microservices architecture, 4 projects
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 15+ entities → model/service tasks
   → contracts/: 3 API files → 15+ contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract infrastructure decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract user journeys → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, infrastructure, CI/CD
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, E2E tests
   → Core: models, services, APIs, contexts
   → Integration: auth, sync, AI services, mobile
   → Polish: performance, monitoring, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different services/files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Same service/file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD requirement)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph based on service interactions
7. Create parallel execution examples for CI/CD
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests? YES (15+ test tasks)
   → All entities have models? YES (15+ model tasks)
   → All contexts implemented? YES (5 core contexts)
9. Return: SUCCESS (75+ tasks ready for execution)
```
