# Implementation Plan: Fataplus Agritech Platform

**Branch**: `001-fataplus-agritech-platform` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: specs/001-fataplus-agritech-platform/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-fataplus-agritech-platform/spec.md`

## Summary

Fataplus is a multi-context SaaS platform for African agriculture that combines the flexibility of custom applications with modular architecture. The platform will serve individual farmers, cooperatives, and agricultural businesses with AI-powered tools for weather prediction, livestock management, e-commerce, LMS, and gamification.

**Technical Approach**: Full-stack web application with microservices architecture, offline-first capabilities, and AI integration for agricultural decision support.

## Constitution Check

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 4 (web-frontend, web-backend, mobile-app, ai-services)
- Using framework directly? Yes - Next.js, FastAPI, React Native
- Single data model? Yes - shared schemas across services
- Avoiding patterns? Repository pattern justified for complex agricultural domain

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes - contexts are modular libraries
- Libraries: weather-context, livestock-context, market-context, gamification-context
- CLI per library: Each context exposes CLI for data management
- Library docs: llms.txt format for AI context understanding

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced
- Git commits show tests before implementation
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed
- Real dependencies: PostgreSQL, Redis, external APIs
- Integration tests for: context communication, data synchronization

**Observability**:
- Structured logging: Winston with correlation IDs
- Frontend logs → backend: Unified logging pipeline
- Error context: Full stack traces with user context

**Versioning**:
- Version number: 1.0.0 (initial release)
- BUILD increments: Semantic versioning for all contexts
- Breaking changes: Parallel testing, migration scripts

**Structure Decision**: Web/mobile application with microservices - 4 main projects (web-frontend, web-backend, mobile-app, ai-services) plus shared infrastructure

## Phase 0: Research & Technical Analysis

### Research Tasks Identified:
1. **African Connectivity Infrastructure**: Research internet penetration rates, mobile network coverage, and data costs across target African countries
2. **Agricultural Data Sources**: Identify reliable weather APIs, market data providers, and agricultural extension services for African context
3. **Offline-First Patterns**: Research best practices for offline-capable web applications in low-connectivity environments
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Analyze requirements for supporting African languages (Swahili, Arabic, French, Portuguese, etc.)
5. **Mobile Money Integration**: Research mobile payment systems (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, etc.) and integration approaches
6. **AI Model Selection**: Evaluate agricultural AI models for weather prediction, disease detection, and market analysis
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Research agricultural data regulations in target African countries

### Research Agents to Dispatch:
```
Task: "Research internet connectivity and mobile data costs in Madagascar, Senegal, Kenya, Nigeria, and Ethiopia"
Task: "Find best practices for offline-first web applications in rural African contexts"
Task: "Identify reliable weather APIs and agricultural data sources for East and West Africa"
Task: "Evaluate AI models suitable for agricultural applications in developing countries"
Task: "Research mobile money integration patterns for African fintech applications"
```

**Output**: research.md with all technical unknowns resolved and architectural decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Design (data-model.md):
1. **User Entities**: Individual Farmer, Cooperative Member, Business Employee with role hierarchies
2. **Agricultural Entities**: Farm, Crop, Livestock, Equipment with spatial data and time-series tracking
3. **Context Entities**: Modular contexts with configuration, data sources, and AI model integration
4. **Market Entities**: Product listings, transactions, pricing data with multi-currency support
5. **Learning Entities**: Courses, progress tracking, certifications with gamification elements

### API Contract Generation:
1. **User Management**: Authentication, profile management, role-based access control
2. **Context APIs**: Dynamic context loading, configuration, data synchronization
3. **Agricultural APIs**: Farm management, crop/livestock tracking, equipment monitoring
4. **Market APIs**: Product listings, transactions, pricing intelligence
5. **Learning APIs**: Course delivery, progress tracking, certification management
6. **AI Services**: Weather prediction, disease detection, market analysis, recommendations

### Contract Test Generation:
- One test file per API endpoint group
- Tests assert request/response schemas using OpenAPI specifications
- All tests initially fail (red phase of TDD)

### Integration Test Scenarios:
- Cross-context data synchronization
- Offline/online data reconciliation
- Multi-language content delivery
- Real-time collaborative features for cooperatives

### Agent Context Update:
- Update CLAUDE.md with new technologies and patterns
- Add African agricultural domain knowledge
- Include offline-first and multi-language considerations

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/ directory, failing tests, quickstart.md, updated agent context files

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load design documents (data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md)
- Generate tasks for each identified component and integration point
- Each API contract → contract test task [P] (parallel execution possible)
- Each data entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user journey → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make all tests pass following TDD principles

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup tasks first (infrastructure, basic project structure)
- Contract tests before implementation (TDD requirement)
- Data models before services that depend on them
- Core services before UI components
- Integration tests after individual components work
- End-to-end tests last to validate complete user journeys

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Multiple contract tests can run simultaneously
- Independent context modules can be developed in parallel
- UI components for different contexts can be built concurrently
- Mobile and web frontends can be developed in parallel

**Estimated Output**: 60-80 numbered tasks covering:
- 15+ contract test tasks
- 20+ model/service implementation tasks
- 10+ integration test tasks
- 15+ UI component tasks
- 10+ infrastructure and deployment tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| 4 projects instead of max 3 | Microservices architecture required for AI services isolation | Monolithic approach would couple AI dependencies with main application |
| Repository pattern | Complex agricultural domain requires data access abstraction | Direct DB queries would create tight coupling and make testing difficult |
| Multi-language support | African market requires support for 10+ languages | Single language would limit market reach and user adoption |
