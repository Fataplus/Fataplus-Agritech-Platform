# Implementation Plan: Fataplus Agritech Platform

**Branch**: `001-fataplus-agritech-platform` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: specs/001-fataplus-agritech-platform/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-fataplus-agritech-platform/spec.md`

## Summary

Fataplus is a multi-context SaaS platform for African agriculture that combines the flexibility of custom applications with modular architecture. The platform will serve individual farmers, cooperatives, and agricultural businesses with AI-powered tools for weather prediction, livestock management, e-commerce, LMS, and gamification.

**Technical Approach**: Full-stack web application with microservices architecture, offline-first capabilities, and AI integration for agricultural decision support.

## Constitution Check

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 4 (web-frontend, web-backend, mobile-app, ai-services)
- Using framework directly? Yes - Next.js, FastAPI, React Native
- Single data model? Yes - shared schemas across services
- Avoiding patterns? Repository pattern justified for complex agricultural domain

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes - contexts are modular libraries
- Libraries: weather-context, livestock-context, market-context, gamification-context
- CLI per library: Each context exposes CLI for data management
- Library docs: llms.txt format for AI context understanding

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced
- Git commits show tests before implementation
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed
- Real dependencies: PostgreSQL, Redis, external APIs
- Integration tests for: context communication, data synchronization

**Observability**:
- Structured logging: Winston with correlation IDs
- Frontend logs → backend: Unified logging pipeline
- Error context: Full stack traces with user context

**Versioning**:
- Version number: 1.0.0 (initial release)
- BUILD increments: Semantic versioning for all contexts
- Breaking changes: Parallel testing, migration scripts

**Structure Decision**: Web/mobile application with microservices - 4 main projects (web-frontend, web-backend, mobile-app, ai-services) plus shared infrastructure

## Phase 0: Research & Technical Analysis

### Research Tasks Identified:
1. **African Connectivity Infrastructure**: Research internet penetration rates, mobile network coverage, and data costs across target African countries
2. **Agricultural Data Sources**: Identify reliable weather APIs, market data providers, and agricultural extension services for African context
3. **Offline-First Patterns**: Research best practices for offline-capable web applications in low-connectivity environments
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Analyze requirements for supporting African languages (Swahili, Arabic, French, Portuguese, etc.)
5. **Mobile Money Integration**: Research mobile payment systems (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, etc.) and integration approaches
6. **AI Model Selection**: Evaluate agricultural AI models for weather prediction, disease detection, and market analysis
7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Research agricultural data regulations in target African countries

### Research Agents to Dispatch:
```
Task: "Research internet connectivity and mobile data costs in Madagascar, Senegal, Kenya, Nigeria, and Ethiopia"
Task: "Find best practices for offline-first web applications in rural African contexts"
Task: "Identify reliable weather APIs and agricultural data sources for East and West Africa"
Task: "Evaluate AI models suitable for agricultural applications in developing countries"
Task: "Research mobile money integration patterns for African fintech applications"
```

**Output**: research.md with all technical unknowns resolved and architectural decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Design (data-model.md):
1. **User Entities**: Individual Farmer, Cooperative Member, Business Employee with role hierarchies
2. **Agricultural Entities**: Farm, Crop, Livestock, Equipment with spatial data and time-series tracking
3. **Context Entities**: Modular contexts with configuration, data sources, and AI model integration
4. **Market Entities**: Product listings, transactions, pricing data with multi-currency support
5. **Learning Entities**: Courses, progress tracking, certifications with gamification elements

### API Contract Generation:
1. **User Management**: Authentication, profile management, role-based access control
2. **Context APIs**: Dynamic context loading, configuration, data synchronization
3. **Agricultural APIs**: Farm management, crop/livestock tracking, equipment monitoring
4. **Market APIs**: Product listings, transactions, pricing intelligence
5. **Learning APIs**: Course delivery, progress tracking, certification management
6. **AI Services**: Weather prediction, disease detection, market analysis, recommendations

### Contract Test Generation:
- One test file per API endpoint group
- Tests assert request/response schemas using OpenAPI specifications
- All tests initially fail (red phase of TDD)

### Integration Test Scenarios:
- Cross-context data synchronization
- Offline/online data reconciliation
- Multi-language content delivery
- Real-time collaborative features for cooperatives

### Agent Context Update:
- Update CLAUDE.md with new technologies and patterns
- Add African agricultural domain knowledge
- Include offline-first and multi-language considerations

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/ directory, failing tests, quickstart.md, updated agent context files

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load design documents (data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md)
- Generate tasks for each identified component and integration point
- Each API contract → contract test task [P] (parallel execution possible)
- Each data entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user journey → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make all tests pass following TDD principles

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup tasks first (infrastructure, basic project structure)
- Contract tests before implementation (TDD requirement)
- Data models before services that depend on them
- Core services before UI components
- Integration tests after individual components work
- End-to-end tests last to validate complete user journeys

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Multiple contract tests can run simultaneously
- Independent context modules can be developed in parallel
- UI components for different contexts can be built concurrently
- Mobile and web frontends can be developed in parallel

**Estimated Output**: 60-80 numbered tasks covering:
- 15+ contract test tasks
- 20+ model/service implementation tasks
- 10+ integration test tasks
- 15+ UI component tasks
- 10+ infrastructure and deployment tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 2.5: Mobile App RAG Implementation Plan

### Overview
To address the unique challenges of limited internet connectivity in rural Madagascar, Fataplus implements an innovative offline LLM (Large Language Model) solution within the mobile application. This system enables farmers to access AI-powered agricultural assistance even without internet connectivity.

### Implementation Approach
The mobile app RAG implementation follows a phased approach:

#### Phase 1: Core RAG Integration (Week 12)
- Integrate React Native RAG library into the mobile app
- Implement offline LLM inference with ExecuTorch
- Add SQLite vector store persistence for knowledge base
- Create RAG service for document management and retrieval
- Build basic chat interface for LLM interaction

#### Phase 2: Peer-to-Peer Sharing (Week 13)
- Implement QR code generation for local LLM sharing
- Build hotspot connectivity functionality
- Create connection interface for users to join technician's LLM
- Implement chat session management between connected users

#### Phase 3: Chat Traceability (Week 14)
- Add chat logging functionality for conversation history
- Implement local storage of chat sessions using AsyncStorage
- Create sync mechanism for chat logs when connectivity is available
- Build chat history retrieval and display features

#### Phase 4: Optimization and Testing (Week 15)
- Optimize for low-resource devices common in Madagascar
- Test offline functionality in simulated environments
- Validate peer-to-peer sharing and connectivity features
- Performance testing under various network conditions

### Technical Components
1. **RAG Service**: Core service managing LLM operations and vector store
2. **QR Service**: QR code generation and parsing for peer-to-peer connections
3. **Network Service**: WiFi P2P connectivity and hotspot management
4. **Chat Service**: Session management and message persistence
5. **UI Components**: Interface for local LLM interaction and connection management

### Dependencies
- React Native RAG library
- ExecuTorch for on-device inference
- SQLite for vector store persistence
- QR code generation libraries
- WiFi P2P connectivity libraries

### Success Metrics
- Farmers can access AI assistance offline
- Peer-to-peer sharing works reliably
- Chat sessions are properly logged and traceable
- App performs well on low-resource devices

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| 4 projects instead of max 3 | Microservices architecture required for AI services isolation | Monolithic approach would couple AI dependencies with main application |
| Repository pattern | Complex agricultural domain requires data access abstraction | Direct DB queries would create tight coupling and make testing difficult |
| Multi-language support | African market requires support for 10+ languages | Single language would limit market reach and user adoption |
| Offline-first architecture | Rural African connectivity challenges | Online-only approach would exclude primary target users |
| Peer-to-peer sharing | Limited infrastructure in rural areas | Centralized approach would require reliable internet connectivity |
