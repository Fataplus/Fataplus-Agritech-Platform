# Navigating the Transformation: A

# Strategic Map of Madagascar's

# Agri-Food Sector for Design-Led

# Innovation

## Executive Summary

Madagascar's agriculture and food sector, the backbone of its economy, is at a critical
inflection point. It is moving beyond a state of chronic vulnerability toward a period of
structured, intentional transformation. This shift is not a gradual evolution but a dynamic
convergence of forces: deep-seated systemic needs are being met by explicit national policy
and supercharged by substantial international investment. This powerful alignment has
created an ecosystem-wide mandate for innovation, opening an unprecedented window of
opportunity for design-driven solutions to address core challenges in value addition, market
access, climate resilience, and consumer engagement. For a product design agency like
Fataplus, this landscape represents a fertile ground for establishing a strategic market
position.

The analysis reveals that the most promising opportunities for collaboration can be
categorized into distinct archetypes. First is the **Innovation Accelerator** , partnering with a
burgeoning class of mission-driven agri-tech startups and social enterprises who require
holistic design support—from product development to brand creation—to scale their
disruptive solutions. Second is the **Brand Modernizer** , working with established food
processors and exporters in high-value chains like vanilla and cocoa who need to refine their
brand stories, innovate their packaging, and enhance their digital presence to compete on a
global stage. Third is the **Capacity-Building Partner** , collaborating with international
development programs and NGOs to design more effective, human-centered tools and
services for their beneficiaries, thereby embedding design thinking into the very fabric of the
sector's development.

This report provides a comprehensive map of this evolving ecosystem. It analyzes the
macro-level drivers of change, conducts a deep dive into key value chains to identify specific


design intervention points, and profiles the primary stakeholder groups. The analysis
culminates in a prioritized list of high-potential partners and a strategic roadmap for market
entry. By understanding these dynamics, Fataplus can move beyond the role of a service
provider to become a core strategic partner, helping to shape a more resilient, valuable, and
sustainable food future for Madagascar.

## 1. The Strategic Landscape: Drivers of Change in

## Madagascar's Agri-Food Sector

To identify viable opportunities, it is essential to first understand the macro-environmental
context. Madagascar's agri-food sector is defined by a fundamental tension between its
profound economic importance and its deep-seated structural weaknesses. This tension has
catalyzed a coordinated response from both national government and international partners,
creating a top-down and bottom-up push for fundamental transformation. This concerted
effort is the primary driver creating demand for the innovative, value-adding services that a
design agency can provide.

### 1.1 The Paradox of Potential and Peril: An Economic Backbone Under

### Strain

Agriculture is the foundation of the Malagasy economy and society. The sector employs over
75% of the active population and is the primary source of livelihood for approximately 85% of
the country's citizens.^1 It is also a critical source of foreign exchange, with agricultural

products accounting for 60-65% of export earnings.^4 However, this vital sector is beset by
systemic vulnerabilities that constrain productivity, limit growth, and perpetuate poverty.

A core challenge is persistently low productivity. The sector is dominated by small, fragmented
family farms, averaging just 1.3 hectares.^5 These farms are characterized by a low use of
modern agricultural practices, limited mechanization, and a reliance on basic tools like
machetes and shovels.^1 This structure hampers economies of scale and makes the
widespread adoption of new technologies difficult.

This low-productivity environment is dangerously exposed to climate shocks. As one of the
world's most climate-vulnerable countries, Madagascar faces recurring natural disasters,
including devastating droughts, intense cyclones, and erratic rainfall.^7 The southern regions,


known as the Grand Sud, are particularly affected, leading to frequent crop loss and even
complete harvest failures that push millions into acute food insecurity.^9 This climatic volatility
makes traditional subsistence farming an increasingly precarious livelihood.

These issues are compounded by severe infrastructure deficits. Poor road networks,
unreliable electricity, and inadequate storage facilities create significant barriers between
farmers and markets.^3 This isolation increases post-harvest losses, which can be substantial,
and disincentivizes farmers from investing in productivity-enhancing measures, as they
cannot be sure of selling their surplus.^12

The direct human consequence of these interconnected challenges is a state of chronic food
insecurity and malnutrition. As of 2022, millions of people across Madagascar were classified
as food insecure, with the country ranking 10th globally for stunting caused by chronic
malnutrition.^9 An estimated 98% of the population cannot afford a healthy diet.^15 This creates
a pressing need for solutions that not only increase food production but also enhance the
nutritional value and accessibility of available food.

### 1.2 National Ambitions and Policy Frameworks: The Top-Down Push

### for Transformation

In response to these profound challenges, the Government of Madagascar has articulated a
clear strategic vision for the agricultural sector, creating the political mandate for a period of
accelerated change. These national policies provide a framework that guides the actions of all
stakeholders in the ecosystem.

The **Plan Émergence Madagascar (PEM)** serves as the country's overarching national
development strategy. Within this plan, achieving food self-sufficiency and boosting the
growth and resilience of the rural sector are stated as high-level priorities.^12 This commitment
from the highest level of government signals to ministries, private sector actors, and
international donors that agriculture is a primary focus for national investment and reform.

More specifically, the government, with support from the United Nations, developed the
**National Pathway for Food System Transformation** in 2022. This detailed roadmap outlines
three central pillars for action: (1) promoting access to diversified, healthy, and nutritious
food; (2) fostering governance for equitable and resilient livelihoods; and (3) promoting
climate-resilient production.^15 Each of these pillars represents a direct entry point for
design-led innovation. Improving access to healthy food requires effective product
development and branding. Ensuring equitable livelihoods necessitates the design of inclusive
market access systems. And building climate resilience depends on the development of new


tools and practices that are readily adoptable by farmers.

To operationalize this pathway, the **National Taskforce for Food Systems Transformation**
has been revitalized. This body acts as a central coordinating platform, bringing together
government ministries, private sector representatives, and development partners to
harmonize efforts, share resources, and overcome implementation bottlenecks.^7 For an
external partner like Fataplus, this task force represents a key strategic node for building
relationships and gaining visibility across the entire sector.

Underpinning these efforts is a foundational **Land Reform Initiative**. The Madagascar
Agriculture Rural Growth and Land Management Project (CASEF), supported by the World
Bank, is a massive undertaking to issue land certificates to rural households.^2 Historically, the
lack of formal land tenure has been a major barrier to investment, as farmers could not use
their primary asset as collateral for credit. By formalizing land rights at a drastically reduced
cost—from $600 down to $25 per document—the project empowers farmers to secure loans,
invest in inputs like fertilizers, diversify their crops, and ultimately increase their income and
confidence.^2 This reform is creating a new class of rural entrepreneurs who are better
positioned and more motivated to engage with value-adding opportunities, including those
offered by design services.

### 1.3 The International Development Nexus: Funding the Transformation

The government's national ambitions are being met with substantial financial and technical
support from a cohort of international development partners. This influx of capital is the
engine driving the implementation of the transformation agenda, creating a robust market for
a wide range of professional services. The strategic alignment between national policy and
international funding has produced a powerful, coordinated push for innovation across the
sector.

```
● The World Bank is a leading partner, financing large-scale, integrated projects that
address multiple facets of the agricultural challenge. Its portfolio includes investments in
rehabilitating irrigation, improving infrastructure, strengthening value chains, and
supporting the aforementioned land reform.^16 Critically, the Bank's strategy has shifted
from a primary focus on direct support to smallholders toward a greater emphasis on
fostering agribusinesses and value chains, signaling a clear intent to leverage private
sector actors as drivers of growth.^17 A recent project, co-financed with the French
Development Agency (AFD), allocates $227 million to increase productivity and resilience,
directly targeting 150,000 households and financing the rehabilitation of 30,
hectares of irrigated land.^16
● The World Food Programme (WFP) is implementing its Country Strategic Plan for
```

```
2024–2028, guided by the vision to "transform food systems and social protection for a
resilient Madagascar".^12 With a budget of over $659 million, this plan focuses on building
sustainable food systems, improving nutrition (especially for women and children), and
strengthening the government's capacity for emergency response.^12 The WFP actively
seeks to partner with the private sector and explicitly invites companies and startups to
apply for its "Innovation Challenge," presenting a direct channel for engagement.^18
● The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has designated Madagascar
as a focus country for its global food security initiative, Feed the Future.^19 USAID invests
in market-led agricultural growth, nutrition-sensitive food systems, and climate
adaptation. Its programs are implemented through a network of trusted partners,
including international NGOs like Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and Cultivating New
Frontiers in Agriculture (CNFA), who work directly with communities and local enterprises
on the ground.^20
● The Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) are collaborating on major initiatives like the $150 million DEFIS+
program. This project aims to enhance the climate resilience of agricultural value chains
and will support nearly 5 million smallholder farmers by improving their market access
and production systems.^22
● The European Investment Bank (EIB) is also playing a key role in fostering sustainable
private sector models. In a significant move, the EIB has provided a €20 million loan to
Sahanala, a Malagasy social enterprise, to professionalize agriculture and fishing value
chains.^23 This investment underscores a trend among development finance institutions to
directly support commercially viable enterprises that deliver social and environmental
impact.
```
The convergence of these forces—a clear systemic need, an articulated political will, and a set
of well-funded mandates—has created a uniquely favorable environment for innovation.
Stakeholders across the ecosystem, from government ministries to small cooperatives, are not
merely open to new ideas; they are actively seeking and being incentivized to adopt innovative
solutions to meet the ambitious goals of this national transformation. Design, as a discipline
focused on creating value through user-centered problem-solving, is a critical tool for this
process. Fataplus can therefore position its services not as a simple commodity but as a key
enabler for achieving the shared objectives of the Malagasy government and its international
partners.

## 2. Value Chain Deep Dive: Identifying Design

## Intervention Points


While the macro-level trends indicate a sector ripe for innovation, a granular analysis of
specific value chains is required to identify tangible and actionable opportunities.
Madagascar's agri-food economy can be broadly segmented into distinct value chains, each
with its own unique set of actors, challenges, and design needs. The requirements of a
premium vanilla exporter competing in a sophisticated global market are fundamentally
different from those of a local cooperative seeking to reduce post-harvest losses in rice. A
successful market-entry strategy for Fataplus must recognize and cater to this diversity.

### 2.1 High-Value Exports (Vanilla, Cocoa, Spices): The Battle for

### Premiumization and Storytelling

These sectors represent Madagascar's flagship agricultural exports and are crucial sources of
foreign currency. However, they are characterized by intense global competition and price
volatility.^3 Success in these markets is increasingly dependent not just on the quality of the
raw product, but on the ability to build a compelling brand, communicate a story of origin and
ethics, and ensure traceability through the supply chain.

**Vanilla** is Madagascar's most famous export, with the country producing up to 80% of the
world's supply, involving an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 farmers.^3 The sector's primary
challenges are extreme price fluctuations, maintaining quality standards, and ensuring that a
fair share of the final price reaches the smallholder farmers.^25 For processors and exporters,
the key to navigating this volatility is to move from selling a commodity to marketing a
premium, differentiated product.

```
● Design Opportunities:
○ Branding & Packaging: For exporters like Madagascar Spices Company and LA
SAVEUR VANILLE , there is a clear need for premium branding that effectively
communicates key value propositions such as origin (e.g., the SAVA region),
certifications (Organic, Fairtrade), and unique flavor profiles.^28 This extends to
packaging design that not only preserves the delicate aroma and quality of the
vanilla beans but also tells a compelling story on the retail shelf, justifying a higher
price point.
○ Product Development: Companies like Madagascar Vanilla Company are already
innovating beyond the raw bean, creating value-added products such as vanilla
paste, pure ground powder, and extracts.^30 Each new product requires its own
distinct branding, packaging, and go-to-market strategy, representing a complete
design project.
○ User Experience (UX) & Service Design: A significant opportunity lies in designing
traceability systems. By incorporating simple technologies like QR codes on
packaging, brands can allow consumers to trace their vanilla back to a specific
```

```
cooperative or village. This service design enhances transparency, builds consumer
trust, and provides a powerful marketing tool.
```
**Cocoa** from Madagascar is globally recognized as a fine-flavor, specialty product, prized for
its unique fruity and citrus notes. It represents a small fraction (around 0.5%) of global
production, making it a niche, high-value market.^31 A major trend within Madagascar is the
development of a local "tree-to-bar" chocolate industry, which captures significantly more
value within the country.

```
● Design Opportunities:
○ Brand Identity: For local chocolate makers like Chocolat Madagascar
(Chocolaterie Robert) , the brand is the core asset. Their identity is meticulously
built around concepts of freshness ("freshly produced in Madagascar"), unique origin
(the Sambirano Valley), and ethical production ("RaiseTrade").^32 Fataplus can assist
new entrants in this growing space to develop similarly powerful brand identities or
help existing players refine their messaging for new international markets.
○ Packaging Design: The premium nature of Malagasy chocolate demands equally
premium packaging. This involves creating designs that protect the product during
international shipping, stand out in the crowded craft chocolate market, and visually
communicate the product's origin and quality. This applies to various formats, from
consumer bars to couverture for chefs.^31
○ Retail & User Experience (UX): As brands like Chocolat Madagascar use factory
tours and tasting rooms as key marketing tools, there is an opportunity to design the
entire visitor experience, from online booking to in-person educational displays and
retail environments, to be more immersive and memorable.^34
```
### 2.2 Domestic Food Security (Rice, Cassava, Pulses): The Drive for

### Efficiency and Nutrition

This category includes the staple crops that form the foundation of the national diet. Here,
the challenges are less about international branding and more about fundamental issues of
productivity, efficiency, post-harvest loss, and nutrition.^5 Design interventions in this space
are focused on creating practical, scalable, and impactful solutions that improve food security
and livelihoods for the majority of the population.

**Rice** is the primary staple food, yet Madagascar remains a net importer due to a combination
of low yields, inefficient farming techniques, and significant infrastructure gaps that hinder
distribution.^3 The government has set an ambitious national goal of achieving rice
self-sufficiency, creating a strong impetus for interventions that boost the local rice value


chain.^14

```
● Design Opportunities:
○ Local Market Branding: There is an opportunity to create trusted local rice brands
that communicate quality, cleanliness, and origin (e.g., "Premium Rice from the
Alaotra Region"). Strong branding can help locally produced rice compete more
effectively against cheaper, often lower-quality, imports.
○ Functional Packaging Design: A significant portion of rice harvests is lost to pests
and spoilage during storage.^1 Designing cost-effective, durable, and hermetically
sealed packaging for both farmers and consumers can directly address this critical
issue, preserving value and improving food availability.
○ Service Design: Post-harvest losses are also a result of inefficient systems. There is
a need to design better services for crop aggregation, storage, and logistics,
particularly for farmers' cooperatives, to ensure that more of the harvest reaches the
market in good condition.^14
```
**Value-Added Processing of Staples** is a growing area of focus for development partners
and social enterprises. Initiatives are underway to transform traditional staples like cassava,
sweet potatoes, and maize into higher-value, more convenient, and more nutritious
products.^35

```
● Design Opportunities:
○ New Product Development & Branding: This is a prime area for holistic design
intervention. It involves co-creating entirely new food products, such as fortified
flours, ready-to-eat snacks, or pre-packaged meal ingredients. This process includes
everything from product naming and brand identity to packaging and marketing. The
social enterprise Nutri'zaza provides an excellent case study with its "Koba Aina
Flash" fortified infant flour. Its success is rooted in a design process that focused on
user needs (easy and quick to prepare), nutritional value, and an affordable price
point, delivered through innovative distribution channels.^37
○ Packaging for Nutrition & Usability: For products aimed at improving nutrition, the
packaging itself is a critical communication tool. Design is needed to present
nutritional information, preparation instructions, and health benefits in a clear,
simple, and visually engaging way, often for a population with varying levels of
literacy. This requires a deep understanding of the user context and a focus on
iconography and simple language.
```
### 2.3 Emerging Growth Sectors (Aquaculture, Processed Fruits,

### Horticulture): Building Brands from the Ground Up


These sectors are being actively promoted by the government and development partners as
key avenues for economic diversification, climate resilience, and income generation.^17
Because many of these value chains are nascent, they often lack established brands, market
infrastructure, and defined quality standards. This presents a "blank slate" opportunity for
design to shape the market from its inception.

**Aquaculture** has been identified by organizations like the Zero Hunger Coalition as a
high-potential area for simultaneously enhancing food production and improving nutritional
outcomes.^15 The FAO is actively supporting the sector's development in partnership with
private companies like

**Royal Tilapia** , which works with local cooperatives.^38

```
● Design Opportunities:
○ Brand Creation: As processed fish products enter the domestic market, there is a
need to create new consumer-facing brands from scratch. This is an opportunity to
define the category, build trust in farmed fish, and establish a benchmark for quality.
○ Packaging Innovation: The development of a robust aquaculture sector will require
effective cold-chain packaging solutions for fresh, frozen, and value-added fish
products, suitable for both local supermarkets and potential export markets.
```
**Processed Fruits** are gaining traction, with companies like **Fruits de Madagascar** and
**SCRIMAD** leading the way. They process local fruits such as lychee, pineapple, and mango
into frozen pieces, purees, and juices, primarily for the international food ingredients market.^39

```
● Design Opportunities:
○ B2B Branding & Marketing: These companies need to present a professional and
compelling image to international B2B buyers. This involves creating strong corporate
brand identities, developing high-quality marketing materials (websites, brochures,
product specification sheets), and designing their presence at international trade
fairs.
○ Export-Grade Packaging: Design is crucial for both bulk and potential retail
packaging to ensure it meets international standards for food safety, labeling,
logistics, and sustainability.
```
**Horticulture and New Crops** are the focus of several climate adaptation projects. To
diversify production and improve resilience, partners like USAID are promoting the cultivation
of crops such as peanuts, sorghum, and millet.^42

```
● Design Opportunities:
○ Consumer Education & Branding: For many Malagasy consumers, these crops are
not traditional staples. A significant design challenge is to create brands and
marketing campaigns that educate the public on the nutritional benefits and culinary
uses of these new foods, thereby stimulating demand and creating a market for the
farmers who grow them.
```

```
○ Service Design: There is an opportunity to design the entire go-to-market strategy
for farmer cooperatives entering these new value chains, covering everything from
quality standards and aggregation to branding and sales channel development.
```
The analysis of these value chains reveals a clear dichotomy in design needs. For established,
high-value export sectors, the primary challenge is **differentiation within a mature global
market**. The design work here is focused on brand modernization, premium packaging, and
storytelling to justify a higher price. In contrast, for domestic staples and emerging sectors,
the challenge is more foundational: **market creation, efficiency, and user adoption**. This
requires a different design approach focused on new product development, functional and
educational packaging, and service design to build value chains from the ground up. Fataplus
should therefore develop two distinct "solution packages" to effectively address these
different client needs, positioning itself as a versatile and strategic partner for growth across
the entire agri-food spectrum.

## 3. Stakeholder Ecosystem Mapping and Opportunity

## Analysis

Madagascar's agri-food transformation is driven by a diverse and interconnected network of
stakeholders. Understanding the specific roles, motivations, and challenges of each group is
essential for identifying the most receptive and impactful entry points for a design agency.
The ecosystem can be segmented into four primary categories: international development
partners, private sector processors, innovative startups and social enterprises, and
agricultural cooperatives. The most dynamic and well-resourced opportunities often lie at the
intersection of these groups.

### 3.1 International Development Programs & NGOs: The Enablers and

### Aggregators

This group forms the strategic and financial backbone of the transformation agenda. They act
as funders, project implementers, technical advisors, and capacity builders. While they do not
typically sell commercial products themselves, their success is measured by the sustainable
impact of their programs on their beneficiaries—farmers, cooperatives, and local enterprises.
Their primary need is to design and execute interventions that are effective, scalable, and
demonstrate measurable results to their donors.


```
● Key Players: This category includes multilateral institutions like the World Bank 16 and
UN agencies such as the
World Food Programme (WFP) 12 and the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).^6 It also includes bilateral donors like
USAID and their extensive network of implementing partners, such as Catholic Relief
Services (CRS) and Cultivating New Frontiers in Agriculture (CNFA).^20 Specialist
NGOs like
NCBA CLUSA , which focuses on cooperative development, and Agronomes &
Vétérinaires Sans Frontières (AVSF) , which supports smallholder agro-ecology, are
also critical actors.^45
● Identified Challenges: A core challenge for these organizations is ensuring the adoption
of new technologies and practices by their target communities. They often struggle to
make complex information—on topics like climate-smart agriculture or financial
literacy—accessible and actionable for farmers with low literacy levels. Furthermore, they
are under pressure to demonstrate tangible market linkages for the enterprises they
support and to communicate the impact of their programs effectively.
● Design Opportunities:
○ Service Design: There is a significant opportunity to partner with these
organizations to co-design the structure and delivery of their farmer support
programs. By applying human-centered design principles, Fataplus can help make
these programs more user-friendly, culturally appropriate, and ultimately more
effective.
○ Information Design: A clear and immediate need exists for the creation of
high-quality training materials. This involves transforming dense technical manuals
into clear, visually engaging, and icon-driven guides (in print and digital formats) that
can be easily understood and used by farmers.
○ UX/UI Design: As programs become more digitally enabled, there is a growing need
for user-friendly mobile applications and platforms. The World Bank's use of
"blockchain-boosted input vouchers" is a leading indicator of this trend.^16 Fataplus
can design the user interface and experience for such tools, ensuring they are
intuitive for the end-user.
○ Branding & Communications: These programs often need strong identities to build
recognition and trust within communities. Fataplus can develop branding for specific
projects (e.g., USAID's "Harea" project 21 ) or create collective brands for the products
of the cooperatives they support, giving them a unified market presence.
```
### 3.2 Agri-Food Processors & Exporters: The Established Players

### Seeking an Edge


This group consists of established commercial entities, many of which are long-standing
family businesses, that form the industrial core of the agri-food sector. They process raw
agricultural commodities into value-added products for both domestic consumption and,
critically, for export markets. Their primary drivers are profitability, market share, and
long-term commercial viability.

```
● Key Players: This category is diverse and spans multiple value chains. In spices and
vanilla, it includes companies like Madagascar Spices Company 28 and the numerous
exporters listed on trade platforms.^47 In the premium chocolate sector,
Chocolat Madagascar (Chocolaterie Robert) is a prominent example.^32 The fruit
processing industry includes firms like
CODAL (canning), SCRIMAD (frozen purees), and Fruits de Madagascar (frozen
fruit).^40 In the livestock sector,
BoViMa is developing a modern abattoir for beef exports.^50 The ecosystem also includes
B2B suppliers of equipment and solutions, such as
KROHNE/PHIRAD (processing technology) and Macadams (baking solutions).^51
● Identified Challenges: These companies face intense competition in international
markets. They must constantly adapt to evolving consumer demands, particularly
regarding sustainability, ethical sourcing, and traceability. Many also face the challenge
of modernizing legacy brands to appeal to new generations of consumers and developing
innovative product lines to capture more value from their raw materials.
● Design Opportunities:
○ Brand Refresh & Modernization: For companies with a long history, like CODAL
(founded in 1932), there is a clear opportunity to help them update their brand
identity and packaging. The goal is to appeal to contemporary consumers without
sacrificing the brand equity and heritage they have built over decades.^49
○ Packaging Innovation: This is a critical area. Design is needed to create packaging
that meets stringent international food safety and labeling standards, extends
product shelf life, responds to consumer demand for reduced plastic and sustainable
materials, and provides a strong visual appeal on the retail shelf.
○ New Product Development (NPD): Fataplus can act as an external innovation
partner, collaborating with these companies on the entire NPD lifecycle. This can
range from ideation and prototyping of new flavors or product formats to developing
the branding and launch strategy for the final product.
○ Digital Presence (UX/UI): Many of these companies need to improve their digital
storefronts. This involves redesigning corporate websites and creating compelling
digital marketing content to better showcase their product range and quality to
international B2B buyers and distributors.
```
### 3.3 Agri-Tech & Food-Tech Innovators (Startups & Social Enterprises):


### The Mission-Driven Disruptors

This is a dynamic and rapidly growing segment of the ecosystem. It is composed of young,
agile, and often mission-driven organizations that are using innovative business models and
technology to solve specific, deeply entrenched problems within the value chain. These actors
are typically highly receptive to design thinking, as it aligns with their core ethos of
user-centered problem-solving and innovation.

```
● Key Players:
○ Sahanala: A standout example of a large-scale social enterprise owned by its farmer
and fisher members. With a major loan from the EIB, it is focused on professionalizing
staple crop and seafood value chains in a sustainable manner.^23
○ Bii: A social enterprise with a circular economy model, tackling food waste by
transforming non-compliant export vegetables into new food products in partnership
with women's cooperatives.^53
○ Tigoun: A tech-focused startup that has developed and is marketing a patented
biodegradable, hermetic storage bag to solve the critical problem of post-harvest
losses for smallholder farmers.^54
○ Sakafo Madagascar: An early-stage startup aiming to create a holistic and
sustainable food processing ecosystem that includes farmer training and converting
organic waste into fertilizer.^55
○ Nutri'zaza: A well-established social enterprise that successfully developed and
markets "Koba Aina," a range of fortified infant flours, through innovative social
marketing and distribution channels.^37
○ Support Ecosystem: The emergence of these innovators is supported by a growing
ecosystem of incubators and funding programs, such as the MIARY AGRIBUSINESS
program, which provides grants and mentorship, and the pan-African GoGettaz
Agripreneur Prize , which showcases and rewards young innovators.^56
● Identified Challenges: As with startups globally, their primary challenges include
securing investment, achieving product-market fit, building a strong and memorable
brand from scratch, designing operational processes that can scale efficiently, and
creating user-friendly technology interfaces.
● Design Opportunities: This segment offers the most holistic and integrated
opportunities for a design agency.
○ Venture Design: Fataplus can engage with these enterprises at the earliest stages,
helping to design the entire business model, service offering, and product strategy
from the ground up.
○ Product Design & Development: This involves the physical design of products, such
as Tigoun's bag or the food products developed by Bii and Nutri'zaza.
○ Brand Identity & Strategy: Creating a compelling brand is crucial for these new
entities to communicate their unique mission and value proposition to investors,
```

```
partners, and their first customers.
○ UX/UI Design: For any innovator using a digital platform—such as Bii's proposed
optimization tool or a potential app for Sahanala's fishers to log their catch—the
quality of the user experience and interface is critical for adoption and success.
○ Service Design: This involves mapping and designing their entire operational flow,
from farmer engagement and raw material sourcing to processing and final product
delivery, ensuring the system is efficient, scalable, and user-centered.
```
### 3.4 Agricultural Cooperatives & Producer Organizations: The Newly

### Empowered Collectives

Cooperatives have a deep-rooted history in Malagasy society, connected to the cultural
principle of _fihavanana_ (kinship and mutual support).^58 Today, they are being formally
promoted as a key mechanism for empowering smallholder farmers. A new cooperative law,
passed in 2023 with support from NCBA CLUSA, is creating a more favorable legal
environment, and numerous NGOs are working to strengthen their business capacity.^45 Their
primary function is to aggregate products from many small farmers to improve their collective
bargaining power and provide more direct access to markets.

```
● Key Players: This group includes a wide range of producer organizations across various
sectors. Examples include Mirary Soa , a vanilla-producing cooperative in the
Analanjirofo Region 45 ;
Manohisoa , a co-op growing rice, cassava, and other staples 59 ; the
FTTV vanilla cooperative 28 ; and the
Loharano vegetable cooperative that partners with Bii.^53 Organizations like the
WWF and the International Labour Organization (ILO) also support the formation and
strengthening of cooperatives as part of their broader development projects.^60
● Identified Challenges: While they have strong social cohesion, many cooperatives lack
professional business management, marketing, and branding skills. They often struggle
with maintaining consistent product quality across their membership and find it difficult
to move beyond selling an undifferentiated commodity to access higher-value, branded
markets.
● Design Opportunities:
○ Collective Branding: This is the most significant opportunity. Fataplus can work with
cooperatives to create a unique collective brand identity. This allows them to market
their products not as anonymous raw materials but as branded goods with a story of
community empowerment and quality. This is a key objective of NCBA CLUSA's new
CDP/CESI project, which aims to organize co-ops into federations, each of which
would require a brand.^62
```

```
○ Packaging Design: A collective brand needs to be applied to packaging. This
involves designing affordable, practical, and visually appealing packaging
solutions—such as a branded bag for Mirary Soa's vanilla or a distinctive label for
Manohisoa's rice—that can be used by all members.
○ Service Design: There is a need to design the internal processes of the cooperative
for quality control, product aggregation, and logistics. A well-designed system
ensures they can consistently meet the quality and volume requirements of larger
buyers.
○ Information Design: Simple, visual tools and communication materials can be
designed to support member training, share market price information, and improve
internal governance.
```
A strategic analysis of this ecosystem reveals that the most dynamic, innovative, and
well-funded activities are happening at the intersection of these stakeholder categories.
These "Nexus Stakeholders" represent the highest-potential clients for a design agency. For
instance, Sahanala is a social enterprise (Category 3.3) owned by cooperatives (Category 3.4),
funded by an international development bank (EIB, Category 3.1), and competing with private
processors (Category 3.2). Similarly, Bii is a social enterprise working with a private processor
(Lecofruit) and a cooperative (Loharano), supported by an innovation fund. These nexus
organizations have complex, multi-faceted needs that require the holistic, problem-solving
approach of strategic design. They are also more likely to appreciate the value of design
because they operate in an impact-oriented, multi-stakeholder environment. A targeting
strategy for Fataplus should therefore prioritize these nexus organizations, as they represent
the most fertile ground for high-impact, strategic design partnerships.

## 4. Prioritized Stakeholder Profiles for Engagement

The following profiles provide a detailed analysis of five high-potential organizations identified
through the ecosystem mapping. These stakeholders have been selected because they
represent different archetypes of opportunity and sit at the nexus of multiple strategic trends,
indicating a high readiness for design-led collaboration. Each profile outlines the
organization's role, its current challenges, and a set of concrete, actionable design
interventions that Fataplus could propose.

### Sahanala: The Nexus Leader

```
● Organization Type: Social Enterprise
```

● **Role in Ecosystem:** Sahanala is a pioneering, large-scale social enterprise that is
majority-owned by the farmers and fishers who are its members. It functions as a
professional aggregator and processor, aiming to build sustainable and profitable value
chains that directly benefit local communities while protecting environmentally sensitive
areas. It represents a powerful model for inclusive, private sector-led development.^23
● **Key Activities:** With a recent investment of €40 million, including a €20 million loan from
the European Investment Bank (EIB), Sahanala is undertaking two major projects. The
first is in western Madagascar (Maintirano), where it is promoting agricultural
mechanization and developing an industrial complex to process maize, rice, and oils for
the domestic market, with the goal of reducing Madagascar's reliance on food imports.
The second project is in northern Madagascar (Vohémar), where it is building a modern,
refrigerated collection and processing center for seafood. A key objective of this second
project is to achieve Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification, which would make
Sahanala the first Malagasy company to export MSC-certified seafood, opening up
access to premium international markets.^23
● **Identified Challenges & Goals:** The primary challenge for Sahanala is the successful
execution and scaling of its ambitious investment plan. This involves complex operational
logistics, achieving and maintaining stringent international certifications like MSC,
creating over 1,500 jobs, and ensuring its commercial operations deliver tangible
financial returns to its thousands of farmer and fisher members. It must build trusted
brands for both domestic and export markets while balancing its dual identity as a
commercially viable business and a mission-driven social enterprise.
● **Concrete Opportunities for Design Intervention:**
○ **Strategic Branding:** Sahanala requires a multi-layered brand architecture. An
overarching corporate brand is needed to communicate its unique social enterprise
model to investors, partners, and the government. Sub-brands are then required for
its product lines: a premium, story-rich brand for its MSC-certified seafood targeted
at discerning European and North American consumers, and a separate, trusted
brand for its staple food products (rice, maize) designed to compete on quality and
reliability in the domestic market.
○ **Packaging Design:** The seafood brand will require export-grade, sustainable
packaging that meets international food safety standards, effectively communicates
the MSC certification, and tells the compelling story of responsible,
community-based fishing. For the domestic staples, the need is for cost-effective,
durable packaging that protects the product, reduces spoilage, and builds brand
recognition among Malagasy consumers.
○ **Service Design:** Achieving MSC certification is as much a process challenge as a
product one. Fataplus can apply service design methodologies to map and optimize
the entire "fisher-to-market" journey. This includes designing the systems for catch
logging, quality control at collection points, and ensuring a seamless, traceable cold
chain—all of which are critical for certification and operational efficiency.
○ **User Experience (UX/UI) Design:** A simple, ruggedized mobile application could be
designed for fishing cooperative leaders to log catch data, receive weather updates,


```
or communicate with the collection center. This would improve data accuracy for
traceability and streamline operations.
```
### Bii: The Waste-to-Value Innovator

```
● Organization Type: Social Enterprise / Startup
● Role in Ecosystem: Bii is a circular economy innovator focused on the intersection of
food waste, food insecurity, and women's economic empowerment. Its model is to
intercept and upcycle produce that is non-compliant with strict export standards (e.g.,
due to size or shape) but is otherwise perfectly edible, transforming this "waste" into
value-added food products.^53
● Key Activities: Bii's operations are built on partnerships. It collaborates with large
agri-food exporters like Lecofruit to secure a consistent supply of surplus vegetables. It
then works with women's cooperatives, such as the Loharano cooperative , to process
these raw materials. Bii provides the training and technical support for the cooperatives
to produce a catalog of certified, high-quality food products. The final stage involves
marketing and distributing these new products. The entire process is being optimized
through a digital solution.^53
● Identified Challenges & Goals: Bii's success depends on its ability to scale its
operations. This means strengthening its processing capacity, training and onboarding
more women's cooperatives into its network, and, most critically, creating a viable and
sustainable commercial market for food products made from what was previously
considered waste. A key goal is to demonstrate a measurable impact on greenhouse gas
reduction (by diverting food from landfills) and women's empowerment.
● Concrete Opportunities for Design Intervention:
○ New Product Development (NPD): This is a core opportunity. Fataplus can work
directly with Bii and its partner cooperatives to design an appealing and
commercially viable range of products from the recovered vegetables. This holistic
process would include recipe co-creation, sensory testing with target consumers,
and defining the unique value proposition for each product (e.g., soups, sauces,
dried snacks, powders).
○ Branding & Packaging: The central branding challenge is to reframe the narrative
from "waste" to "value." Fataplus can create a compelling consumer brand that tells a
positive story of resourcefulness, women's empowerment, delicious food, and
environmental responsibility. The packaging must be attractive, food-safe, affordable,
and clearly communicate this brand story to consumers at the point of sale.
○ Service Design: Bii's "entrepreneurship support model" for women's cooperatives is
a key part of its social impact. Fataplus can help design this program to be more
effective, scalable, and replicable as Bii expands its network. This involves designing
the training curriculum, the operational workflows, and the quality control systems.
```

```
○ UX/UI Design: The "digital solution to optimize the process" is a critical piece of Bii's
infrastructure. Fataplus can design the user interface and experience of this tool to
ensure it is intuitive and efficient for Bii's staff, its corporate partners, and the
cooperative leaders.
```
### Tigoun: The Post-Harvest Pioneer

```
● Organization Type: Startup / Social Enterprise
● Role in Ecosystem: Tigoun is a technology-driven enterprise that has developed an
innovative solution to one of the most widespread and costly problems for smallholder
farmers in Madagascar and beyond: post-harvest crop loss. Its product directly
addresses a critical bottleneck in the agricultural value chain.^54
● Key Activities: Tigoun's core activity is the manufacturing and marketing of a specialized
agricultural conservation bag. This bag is both biodegradable (made with 80% renewable
materials) and hermetic, allowing farmers to store their grain and pulse harvests for
extended periods with less than 1% loss from insects and humidity. This empowers
farmers to avoid selling their entire harvest immediately when prices are lowest, enabling
them to achieve better food security and higher incomes.^54
● Identified Challenges & Goals: The primary challenge is achieving widespread market
adoption and scale. Tigoun needs to convince millions of smallholder farmers to switch
from the cheap, familiar, but ineffective petro-sourced plastic bags to their new,
innovative product. This requires building trust, demonstrating a clear return on
investment, and establishing an effective distribution network to reach remote rural
areas. Their long-term goal is to expand beyond Madagascar to other regions in
sub-Saharan Africa.
● Concrete Opportunities for Design Intervention:
○ Brand & Product Communication: While the product itself is designed, the
communication around it is paramount. Fataplus can design a communication
strategy that uses clear, simple, and visual language to explain the bag's benefits.
This includes designing icon-based instructions printed directly on the bag, creating
simple print marketing materials for agro-dealers, and developing visual aids for
farmer training sessions.
○ Branding: A strong, trustworthy brand identity is essential. Farmers need to be able
to easily recognize the authentic Tigoun bag and associate it with quality and
reliability. Fataplus can develop a robust brand identity—building on the existing
name—that is memorable and easily distinguishable from potential counterfeit
products.
○ Service Design: The distribution strategy is a critical service design challenge.
Fataplus can help Tigoun map and design the most effective channels to reach
remote farmers. Should they sell through cooperatives? Partner with agro-dealer
```

```
networks? Work with NGOs? The design process would involve creating the sales
pitch, training materials, and incentive structures for these distribution partners.
○ Packaging: While the product is a bag, the packaging for bundles of bags sold to
distributors or cooperatives needs to be considered. This "secondary" packaging
must be designed for efficient transport and storage, and it should prominently
feature and reinforce the Tigoun brand.
```
### Chocolat Madagascar (Chocolaterie Robert): The Modernizing

### Exporter

```
● Organization Type: Private Sector Processor / Exporter
● Role in Ecosystem: Chocolat Madagascar is a standard-bearer for value addition at
origin. As one of Africa's first and most renowned "tree-to-bar" chocolate makers, it has
been producing fine chocolate in Madagascar since 1940. It serves as a benchmark for
quality, demonstrating how a Malagasy company can successfully compete in the
premium global craft chocolate market.^32
● Key Activities: The company's operations are fully integrated. They grow fine-flavor
cacao in Madagascar's Sambirano Valley, process the beans in their factory near the
plantations, and craft a wide range of award-winning chocolate products, including
couverture for chefs, single-origin bars, and innovative products like "raw" chocolate. A
core part of their identity is the "RaiseTrade" model, which emphasizes the economic
benefits of exporting a finished product rather than just a raw commodity.^32
● Identified Challenges & Goals: As a mature player in the highly competitive global craft
chocolate market, Chocolat Madagascar's primary challenge is to maintain its premium
positioning and continue to differentiate itself. It needs to constantly find new ways to
communicate its unique story of "freshness at origin" to consumers who are inundated
with choices. It may also be exploring new product lines or sub-brands to drive further
growth.
● Concrete Opportunities for Design Intervention:
○ Packaging Evolution: While their existing packaging is well-regarded, there is
always an opportunity for evolution. Fataplus could propose designing special edition
packaging for specific single-estate chocolates (e.g., from the MAVA plantation) to
highlight terroir. There is also an opportunity to innovate with more sustainable
premium packaging materials, which is a growing expectation among their target
consumers.
○ Digital Experience (UX/UI): Their digital presence could be transformed into a more
immersive storytelling platform. Fataplus can design a website and digital content
strategy that takes consumers on a virtual journey to the Sambirano Valley,
showcasing the farmers, the unique biodiversity, and the "fresh" production process.
This could include interactive maps, high-quality video content, and a more
```

```
sophisticated e-commerce experience.
○ Retail Experience Design: For their physical retail locations in Antananarivo and
Paris, Fataplus can design the complete in-store customer experience. This includes
designing educational displays about the cacao origin, creating guided tasting
materials, and developing signage and product merchandising that deepens
customer engagement and reinforces the brand's premium, authentic identity.^34
```
### NCBA CLUSA: The Cooperative Champion

```
● Organization Type: International NGO / Cooperative Development Organization
● Role in Ecosystem: NCBA CLUSA is a central and highly influential enabler of the
cooperative movement in Madagascar. It provides high-level technical assistance,
advocates for a more favorable policy environment (having co-led the development of
the new national cooperative law), and works directly to build the capacity of both
primary cooperatives and the local organizations that support them.^45
● Key Activities: NCBA CLUSA is currently implementing the five-year, USAID-funded
Cooperative Ecosystem and Social Inclusion (CESI) project. Key activities under this
project include organizing primary cooperatives into higher-tier federations and
confederations, partnering with the University of Antananarivo to establish a training
program on cooperative entrepreneurship, and providing direct, tailored coaching to a
cohort of at least 10 cooperatives and unions. Their work aims to professionalize the
sector and increase the inclusion of women and youth.^45
● Identified Challenges & Goals: The organization's primary goal is to foster a thriving,
self-sufficient cooperative ecosystem. This involves helping individual cooperatives
become viable, well-governed businesses, and ensuring that the new cooperative law is
effectively implemented and understood across the country. A key challenge is making
professional business services, including branding and marketing, accessible and
relevant to nascent producer organizations.
● Concrete Opportunities for Design Intervention:
○ "Branding for Cooperatives" Toolkit: This represents a flagship service design
opportunity. Fataplus could partner with NCBA CLUSA to create a standardized,
easy-to-use toolkit that NCBA CLUSA can then deploy across its entire network of
partner cooperatives. This toolkit could include templates for brand strategy
development, logo design guidelines, and examples of affordable packaging
solutions. By creating this tool, Fataplus would position itself as a thought leader and
scale its impact exponentially, becoming the go-to design partner for the entire
cooperative sector.
○ Brand Development for Federations: The CESI project's goal of forming new
federations of cooperatives presents a direct and immediate design opportunity.
Each new federation will require a unique brand identity, a clear value proposition,
```

```
and a marketing strategy to represent its member cooperatives in the marketplace.
Fataplus can be the strategic partner in creating these new collective brands.
○ Information Design: Fataplus can collaborate with NCBA CLUSA and the University
of Antananarivo to design the curriculum and training materials for their new
cooperative entrepreneurship program. By applying information design principles,
they can make the content more visual, engaging, and effective for adult learners and
aspiring entrepreneurs.
```
## 5. Strategic Recommendations for Fataplus: A

## Roadmap for Market Entry

The analysis of Madagascar's agri-food sector reveals a dynamic and complex landscape with
numerous entry points for a design agency. To succeed, Fataplus must adopt a nuanced and
strategic approach, positioning itself not as a generic service provider but as a specialist
partner in transformation. This requires tailoring its engagement models to different
stakeholder types, developing thought leadership around key thematic areas, and prioritizing
targets based on their strategic alignment and readiness for collaboration.

### 5.1 The Collaboration Blueprint: Tailored Engagement Models

A one-size-fits-all approach will be ineffective. Fataplus should structure its service offerings
into four distinct engagement models, each designed to meet the specific needs and context
of a primary stakeholder group.

```
● The Innovation Accelerator (for Startups & Social Enterprises): This model is
designed for mission-driven disruptors like Sahanala, Bii, and Tigoun. It should be a
holistic "Venture Design" package that goes beyond a single deliverable. The offering
could include brand strategy workshops, product design and prototyping, service design
for operations, and UX/UI development for digital platforms. The positioning is that of a
long-term strategic partner invested in their growth journey. To build a pipeline for this
model, Fataplus should proactively engage with incubators like the MIARY program and
keep a close watch on the finalists of competitions like the GoGettaz Agripreneur Prize.^56
● The Brand Modernizer (for Established Processors): This model targets established
players like Chocolat Madagascar and CODAL. The service offerings should be more
focused, addressing specific commercial challenges. This includes brand refresh
projects, packaging innovation for export markets, and enhancing their digital B2B
```

```
presence. The core value proposition is clear and commercial: helping them increase
their competitiveness, command premium prices in international markets, and connect
with modern consumers.
● The Capacity-Building Partner (for NGOs & Development Programs): This model
positions Fataplus as a "Design for Development" specialist. The client is the NGO or
development agency (e.g., NCBA CLUSA, CRS), but the end-user is their beneficiary.
Services include co-designing the delivery of farmer support programs to be more
human-centered, creating visually accessible training materials on complex topics, and
developing branding and packaging toolkits that the NGO can deploy across its network
of supported enterprises. This B2B model generates revenue while building a wide
network and a strong reputation within the influential development community.
● The Collective Identity Builder (for Cooperatives): This model makes professional
design services accessible to emerging producer organizations. Given that individual
cooperatives may have limited budgets, the most effective approach is to partner with an
enabler like NCBA CLUSA or AVSF. Fataplus could develop a streamlined and affordable
"Co-op Branding Package" that includes a facilitated brand workshop, logo and identity
design, and templates for basic packaging. This could be funded by the NGO for a cohort
of cooperatives, allowing Fataplus to work at scale.
```
### 5.2 Thematic Entry Points: Positioning as a Thought Leader

To differentiate itself and build credibility, Fataplus should proactively develop and
communicate expertise around key themes that are highly relevant to the challenges and
opportunities in Madagascar's agri-food sector. This can be done through white papers,
workshops, and targeted content marketing.

```
● "Designing for Traceability & Trust": Develop a portfolio and methodology focused on
how branding, packaging (e.g., using QR codes), and digital experiences can be used to
tell a product's origin story and validate its ethical and sustainable claims. This theme is
directly applicable to the high-value export sectors of vanilla, cocoa, and the emerging
MSC-certified seafood market.
● "Sustainable Packaging Solutions for Africa": Invest in research and prototyping of
packaging solutions that are low-cost, utilize locally available or renewable materials,
reduce plastic waste, and effectively extend product shelf life. This addresses a universal
need across the sector and is a major requirement for accessing environmentally
conscious European export markets.
● "Human-Centered Design for Smallholder Services": Create case studies and
frameworks demonstrating how service design principles can make agricultural extension
services, financial literacy programs, and market linkage platforms more effective and
readily adopted by smallholder farmers. This positions Fataplus as a strategic partner to
```

```
the development community.
● "Branding Nutrition": Build expertise in creating compelling brands for fortified and
nutritious food products. This involves understanding how to effectively communicate
health benefits to vulnerable populations in a culturally sensitive manner, referencing
successful local examples like Nutri'zaza's Koba Aina Flash to demonstrate relevance and
understanding.^37
```
### 5.3 Priority Engagement Matrix

To translate this strategy into action, the following matrix prioritizes potential stakeholders
based on their strategic fit, the potential impact of a design intervention, and the likely ease of
engagement. This serves as a tactical guide for the Fataplus business development team.
