# The Agricultural Ecosystem of Madagascar: A

# Comprehensive Stakeholder Directory and Value Chain

# Analysis

## Part I: Executive Summary & Ecosystem Overview

**Introduction to Madagascar's Agricultural Sector**

The agricultural sector is the undisputed backbone of Madagascar's economy,

representing a critical source of livelihood for the vast majority of its population and a

significant contributor to its national output. The sector employs over 80% of the

country's population and accounts for more than 20% of its Gross Domestic Product

(GDP).^1 The nation's diverse agro-ecological zones support a wide range of products,

which can be broadly categorized into staple food crops for domestic consumption

and high-value cash crops for export.

The primary food crops are essential for national food security. Rice is the main staple

food, cultivated across 1.34 million hectares in terraced paddy systems, particularly in

the central highlands, and through both rain-fed and irrigated methods elsewhere.^4

Other major subsistence crops include cassava, which is vital for smallholder risk

reduction due to its drought tolerance, as well as maize, sweet potatoes, and a variety

of vegetables.^4 Livestock, dominated by zebu cattle, is also integral, with

approximately 60% of rural families depending on it for income.^4

Madagascar's export economy is heavily reliant on its unique agricultural cash crops.

The country is world-renowned for its high-quality vanilla, which, along with cloves,

coffee, lychee, and pepper, constitutes a primary source of foreign exchange

revenue.^4 The fisheries and aquaculture sub-sectors are also growing in importance,


with shrimp and prawn exports providing a significant income stream.^7

**Core Challenges and Systemic Constraints**

Despite its centrality, the Malagasy agricultural sector faces profound and

interconnected challenges that constrain its productivity and potential for growth.

These issues are both structural and environmental, creating a complex web of

obstacles for the millions of smallholder farmers who form the sector's foundation.

A primary constraint is low agricultural productivity, stemming from a limited adoption

of modern agricultural practices and technologies.^1 The reliance on manual labor is

near-total, with very little mechanization; basic tools like machetes and shovels are

common, but more advanced equipment such as zebu ploughs are rare.^1 This is

compounded by poor transportation and marketing infrastructure, which isolates

farmers from markets and increases post-harvest losses.^1

The sector is exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Madagascar's

geographical location exposes it to extreme weather events, including recurrent and

severe droughts, particularly in the south, and devastating cyclones and floods that

can ruin entire harvests.^3 This climatic volatility makes traditional farming methods and

planting schedules less productive and reliable, exacerbating food insecurity.^6

Systemic governance issues present perhaps the most significant barrier. For

decades, insecure land tenure has been a critical impediment to rural productivity.

Millions of farmers lack official land documents due to cumbersome, lengthy, and

prohibitively expensive titling procedures.^8 This "land crisis" leads to recurrent

conflicts, discourages long-term investment in land improvement, and ultimately

suppresses economic productivity.^8 Furthermore, chronic political instability,

combined with widespread corruption and weak control of natural resources,

undermines economic growth and contributes to high rates of poverty and food

insecurity.^9

**Ecosystem Map and Key Actor Dynamics**

The agricultural landscape in Madagascar is not governed by a single entity but by a


complex interplay of domestic and international actors. The analysis of this ecosystem

reveals a co-dependent "tripod" of power that defines how policies are made, funds

are allocated, and projects are implemented. Understanding this dynamic is

fundamental for any organization seeking to engage effectively in the country's

agricultural development.

The three legs of this tripod are:

1. **Governmental & Para-Statal Bodies:** Led by the Ministry of Agriculture and
    Livestock (MINAE), these institutions provide the official policy and regulatory
    framework. They hold the sovereign mandate but often face limitations in
    financial and operational capacity for large-scale program execution.
2. **International Donors & Development Banks:** Organizations like the World Bank,
    Agence Française de Développement (AFD), GIZ, and various UN agencies are the
    primary sources of capital and technical expertise. They fund the majority of
    large-scale development programs but require legitimate government partnership
    and capable local entities for on-the-ground implementation.
3. **National Farmer Federations & Civil Society:** Powerful national organizations
    like FIFATA, Réseau SOA, and CPM, along with a host of NGOs, serve as the
    essential implementation partners. They possess the extensive grassroots
    networks, local knowledge, and operational capacity to execute projects at the
    community level, effectively acting as the bridge between policy and practice.

This structure creates a system of mutual dependence. Government policy requires

donor funding to become reality; donor projects require government approval and the

implementation capacity of local federations to succeed; and the federations rely on

both government partnership and donor funding to deliver services to their vast

membership. Any successful agricultural initiative in Madagascar must therefore

navigate this tripartite relationship, securing buy-in and collaboration from each of

these core stakeholder groups.

## Part II: Governmental and Para-Statal Framework

**Government Institutions, Agencies, and Research Centers**


The state apparatus provides the legal and strategic direction for agriculture in

Madagascar. Its structure and functions are defined by official decrees, with the

Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock at its core, supported by specialized research

centers and attached agencies.

**Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage -**

**MINAE)**

```
● Mandate and Vision: The MINAE is the principal government body tasked with
designing, implementing, and coordinating the General State Policy (PGE) in the
fields of agriculture and livestock.^10 Its overarching vision is transformational: to
achieve accelerated economic growth in rural areas and establish Madagascar as
the "bread basket of the Indian Ocean and Sub-regions".^10 Key objectives include
sustainably increasing productivity, developing competitive agribusiness systems,
extending production areas, increasing farmer incomes, and contributing to food
security and climate resilience.^10
● Organizational Structure: The ministry's current organization is established by
Décret n° 2024-106 du 1er février 2024 , which repeals previous decrees from
2021 and 2022.^12 The structure comprises a Minister's Cabinet, a General
Secretariat that oversees administrative functions, and two primary technical
arms: the General Directorate of Agriculture (Direction Générale de l'Agriculture -
DGA) and the General Directorate of Livestock (Direction Générale de l'Elevage -
DGE).^11 These general directorates house specialized technical directorates
responsible for specific sub-sectors. At the regional level, the ministry is
represented by 22 Regional Directorates for Agriculture and Livestock (Directions
Régionales de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage - DRAE), which are responsible for
implementing national policies locally and coordinating with regional authorities.^15

**Attached Research Centers and Agencies (Organismes Rattachés)**

Several semi-autonomous public establishments are attached to the ministry,

providing crucial research, development, and training functions.

```
● FOFIFA (Centre National de la Recherche Appliquée au Développement
Rural): Founded in 1974, FOFIFA is the main agricultural research institution in
Madagascar.^16 As a Public Industrial and Commercial Establishment (EPIC), it has
financial and administrative autonomy and is responsible for research programs in
plant production (rice, maize, etc.), animal and fish production, forestry, and
socio-economics.^18 It operates through six central scientific departments and a
```

```
network of regional research centers across the country, developing locally
adapted seed varieties and agricultural techniques.^5
● FIFAMANOR (Fiompiana Fambolena Malagasy Norveziana): Established in
1972 through a bilateral agreement between Madagascar and Norway,
FIFAMANOR is a center for rural development and applied research with EPIC
status.^21 It focuses on the highlands, particularly the Vakinankaratra region,
promoting tuber crops (potato, sweet potato), cereals (wheat, triticale), and dairy
production through genetic improvement and technical support to farmers.^16
● Other Key Bodies: The ministry also oversees other specialized agencies,
including the Fonds de Développement Agricole (FDA) , which manages
agricultural development funds; the Office Malgache du Tabac (OFMATA) for
the tobacco sector; and a network of training centers such as the Centre
d'Application et de Formation Professionnelle Agricole (CAFPA) and the
Centre de Fabrication, de Formation et d'Application du Machinisme et de la
Mécanisation Agricole (CFFAMMA).^11
```
**Public Policy Programmes and National Projects**

The government's strategy is operationalized through several key national programs

that guide sectoral investments and interventions.

```
● Programme Sectoriel Agriculture Elevage Pêche (PSAEP): This is the
country's overarching sectoral program, designed in alignment with the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) framework
of the African Union. The PSAEP serves as the primary strategic document for
guiding development actions and investments across the agriculture, livestock,
and fisheries sectors.^5
● National Land Certification Program: Recognizing insecure land tenure as a
fundamental brake on agricultural investment and productivity, the government
has elevated land certification to a "State Affair".^8 This national priority aims to
dramatically scale up the issuance of legal land certificates to rural farmers, with
a target of producing one million certificates per year. This policy represents a
direct attempt to resolve a decades-long crisis that has suppressed rural
investment by providing farmers with the security needed to invest in their land
for the long term.^8 Projects like the World Bank-funded CASEF have
demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by successfully reducing the cost of
obtaining a land document from over $600 to as low as $25 through inclusive
```

```
methods and digital technologies.^8
● Initiative for the Emergence of Madagascar (IEM): The IEM is the national
development strategy championed by the presidency, which identifies the
modernization of agriculture as a core pillar for achieving economic emergence.^26
The goals of the PSAEP and the land certification program are key components of
this broader vision.
```
## Part III: International Development and Cooperation Landscape

The agricultural sector in Madagascar is heavily supported by a wide range of

international partners who provide critical financing, technical expertise, and program

management. These organizations work in close partnership with government bodies

and local civil society to implement large-scale projects that address the sector's

most pressing challenges.

**Multilateral & Bilateral Partners**

```
● The World Bank Group: As a primary multilateral partner, the World Bank,
through the International Development Association (IDA), finances major projects
targeting systemic reforms. Its flagship interventions focus on improving rural
land tenure security, enhancing market access for smallholders, and rehabilitating
rural infrastructure, as exemplified by the CASEF project.^8
● Agence Française de Développement (AFD): A leading bilateral donor, the AFD
is heavily invested in promoting sustainable agriculture, agroecology, and
biodiversity conservation. In 2025, its portfolio included approximately 15 projects
in the sector, representing around €95 million in investments and benefiting
120,000 people.^28
● Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ): Acting on
behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development (BMZ), GIZ's engagement prioritizes climate-adapted agriculture
and food security. Its projects focus on building resilience through climate field
schools, developing climate risk insurance, and improving value chains for key
products like vanilla.^3
● Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO): The FAO
```

```
provides crucial technical assistance, supports emergency response efforts, and
promotes global initiatives like the Hand-in-Hand program to attract private and
public investment into Madagascar's agricultural sector, focusing on key value
chains such as rice, corn, and red meat.^2
● International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD): IFAD finances
large-scale programs aimed at improving the livelihoods and resilience of
smallholder farmers. A key example is its co-financing of the DEFIS+ program,
which targets market access and climate resilience.^38
● European Union (EU): The EU is a significant donor, funding a wide range of
initiatives. Its support is often channeled through local implementing partners,
such as farmer organizations, to promote youth integration in agriculture, climate
adaptation, and responsible value chains.^3
● United States Agency for International Development (USAID): USAID's
interventions are primarily focused on addressing chronic food insecurity and
malnutrition. Its major programs, like SALOHI, are implemented by consortia of
international and local NGOs to improve household livelihoods and community
resilience in the most vulnerable regions.^42
● European Investment Bank (EIB): The EIB provides long-term financing for
impactful private sector and infrastructure projects. In a significant move, it
provided a €20 million loan to Sahanala, a social enterprise, marking its first
investment in Madagascar's agriculture sector since 2005.^43
```
**Major Donor-Funded Projects**

The strategies of international partners are realized through large, multi-year

programs that often involve a consortium of actors.

```
● Agriculture Rural Growth and Land Management Project (CASEF): Funded by
the World Bank, CASEF is a cornerstone project designed to tackle the dual
challenges of insecure land tenure and poor market access. Its implementing
agencies are the Government of Madagascar, acting through the MINAE and the
Ministry of Land Planning and Land Services (MATSF).^8
● Adaptation of Agriculture Value Chains to Climate Change (PrAda): A GIZ-led
project, co-financed by the EU, that aims to increase the climate resilience of
smallholder farmers. It operates through climate field schools and facilitates
access to financial services like climate risk insurance. Key partners include
MINAE, the National Department of Meteorology (DGM), and private insurance
```

```
companies like ARO.^3
● Inclusive Agricultural Value Chains Programme (DEFIS+): A major USD 150
million program co-financed by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and IFAD.
Launched in 2025, this six-year initiative aims to enhance market access, food
security, and climate resilience for nearly 5 million smallholder farmers across six
regions.^39
● Strengthening and Accessing Livelihoods Opportunities for Household
Impact (SALOHI): An $84.7 million USAID food security program designed to
reduce food insecurity by improving nutrition, household livelihoods, and
community resilience. It is implemented by a consortium of NGOs led by Catholic
Relief Services (CRS) and including Adventist Development and Relief Agency
(ADRA), Land O' Lakes International Development, and CARE.^42
```
The operational structure of these major programs reveals a consistent pattern in how

agricultural development is governed in Madagascar. The government provides the

sovereign mandate and policy framework, but often lacks the financial resources and

ground-level operational capacity for large-scale implementation. International

donors supply the necessary capital and technical oversight but require credible local

partners to execute programs effectively and ensure their sustainability. This is where

national farmer federations and well-established NGOs come in, providing the

essential grassroots networks, local expertise, and implementation workforce. This

creates a de facto public-private-international partnership model. For instance, GIZ's

PrAda project works directly with MINAE and local NGOs 3 , while USAID's SALOHI

program is implemented entirely through an NGO consortium.^42 This demonstrates

that any new initiative, whether from an investor or a development organization, must

navigate this tripartite structure to succeed, requiring alignment with government

policy, donor priorities, and the operational realities of implementing partners.

## Part IV: Producer Organizations and Civil Society

Civil society, particularly the large national farmer federations, forms a crucial pillar of

the agricultural ecosystem. These organizations act as the collective voice for

hundreds of thousands of smallholder farmers, serving as vital partners for both the

government and international donors in the implementation of development programs.

**National Farmers’ Federations**

Three major federations dominate the landscape, each with a distinct focus and

extensive regional network.

```
● FIFATA (Fikambanana Fampivoarana ny Tantsaha): Founded in 1989, FIFATA is
a national association for the progress of farmers, representing approximately
369,500 family agricultural holdings across 12 regions.^49 Its mission is to support a
professional and competitive family farming model. FIFATA is highly
```

```
service-oriented, working with its member organizations to develop and deliver
concrete services to farmers, including agricultural advice, training, animal health
services, and access to credit.^50 It also plays a key advocacy role, representing
farmer interests in national bodies like the Agricultural Development Fund (FDA)
and the National Family Agriculture Committee (CNAF).^49
● Réseau SOA (Syndicat des Organisations Agricoles): Réseau SOA is a union of
25 regional farmer organizations, including both associations and cooperatives.^38
Its primary focus is on trade union action and policy advocacy, complementing
the economic activities of its members.^40 It actively lobbies on key issues such as
land tenure, taxation, and the installation of young farmers, a domain where it is a
key partner for projects funded by the European Union.^38 Réseau SOA holds a
significant institutional role, presiding over the Chamber of Agriculture of
Madagascar and being a member of the national civil society platform "Rohy".^38
● CPM (Coalition Paysanne de Madagascar): Established in 2001, CPM is a
national platform that federates nearly 2,500 base-level farmer organizations
across all 22 regions of Madagascar.^52 Its mission is to defend the interests of its
members through development actions, advocacy, and cohesion, with a strong
focus on food sovereignty and favorable policies for family farming.^52 CPM is an
active participant in major development programs, including the EU-funded
Farmers' Organizations for the African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries
(FO4ACP) project and the IFAD-funded FORMAPROD project.^52
```
**Regional and Sector-Specific Cooperatives**

The national federations are composed of numerous regional and sector-specific

cooperatives and associations that deliver services directly to farmers. These

organizations are often specialized in particular value chains. Examples include:

```
● UCLS (Union de 22 coopératives de Lazan'i Sambirano): A member of Réseau
SOA specializing in the cacao value chain in the Sambirano valley.^38
● ROFAMA (Coopérative de lait): A dairy cooperative in the Haute Matsiatra
region, also a member of Réseau SOA.^38
● KTTF (Coopérative de miel à Manakara): A honey cooperative in Manakara.^38
● PAACO (Produit Agricoles et Artisanaux de la Côte Orientale): A cooperative
founded in 2009 in the Toamasina region, producing and exporting complete
sugar, fruits, and spices under fair trade principles.^55
```

**NGOs and Non-Profits**

A diverse array of national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs)

and non-profits are active in Madagascar's rural and environmental sectors, often

working in partnership with farmer federations and government programs.

```
● Agroecology & Conservation Focus: Organizations in this category promote
sustainable farming practices. Key actors include GSDM (Groupement des
semis directs de Madagascar) , a professional association for agroecology 51 ;
ANAE (Association Nationale d ́Actions Environnementales) ; and ONG TAFA
(Terre et Développement).^56
● Rural Development & Food Security: This group includes large international
NGOs implementing multi-faceted development programs. Notable organizations
are Agrisud International , which supports agro-ecological transition projects
like Mahavotra 28 ;
AVSF (Agronomes & Vétérinaires Sans Frontières) , which supports livestock
farming and fair-trade value chains for lychee and vanilla 57 ; and the major
implementing partners of the USAID SALOHI program:
Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and CARE.^42
● Biodiversity & Environment: Given Madagascar's unique ecosystems, many
organizations focus on conservation, often linking it to sustainable livelihoods.
WWF Madagascar is a major player, working on forest management and
conservation.^56
SEED Madagascar , a UK-based charity, operates in the southeast Anosy region,
managing sustainable development and conservation projects in community
health, education, and rural livelihoods.^58
```
## Part V: The Private Sector Value Chain

The private sector in Madagascar's agriculture is diverse, ranging from small-scale

input suppliers to large multinational agribusinesses focused on export commodities.

This sector is supported by a network of professional federations and chambers of


commerce that facilitate trade and advocate for business interests.

**Agribusinesses by Value-Chain Segment**

**Input Suppliers**

The provision of agricultural inputs is a critical first step in the value chain. Key players

include:

```
● Seeds: Companies like Agri-Vet , a seed and input supply company co-founded
by Francois Grobler and Mirana Rakotovelo, are emerging to produce and
distribute certified seeds for crops like maize.^60
● Fertilizers: Both local and international companies supply fertilizers. Guanomad
SARL specializes in organic fertilizer derived from bat guano.^61
Almada Fertilizer is another provider of organic farming products.^64
● Agricultural Equipment: The market for agricultural machinery is served by
companies like Materauto Equipment , which is the distributor for Massey
Ferguson tractors and Agrional accessories.^65
International Corridor Services (ICS) , in partnership with local entity ITA ,
supplies a range of agricultural equipment and provides project implementation
support.^66
```
**Production & Farming Enterprises**

While the sector is dominated by smallholders, larger commercial enterprises play a

key role in aggregation and production at scale. A prominent example is **Sahanala** , a

social enterprise owned by farmers that manages large-scale agricultural and fishing

operations. It focuses on both domestic crops like maize and rice and export-oriented

fishing, aiming to support economic development and improve the livelihoods of its

farmer-shareholders.^43


**Processing & Transformation**

Value addition through processing is a crucial area for economic growth. Several

companies are leaders in their respective sub-sectors:

```
● Vanilla & Spices: Numerous companies are involved in the export of vanilla and
other spices. The Groupement des Exportateurs de Vanille de Madagascar
(GEVM) lists 45 member companies, including major players like Ramanandraibe
Exportation SA , Floribis , and Trimeta Agro Food.^67
Madagascar Spices Company is another key producer and exporter.^68
● Cacao: Chocolaterie Robert , founded in 1940 and now part of the
Ramanandraibe group, is a leading "bean-to-bar" chocolate manufacturer. It
sources high-quality Trinitario cacao beans primarily from the Sambirano Valley
and controls the entire production process in its Antananarivo facility, producing
award-winning chocolates for both local and international markets.^70
● Fruits & Vegetables: Lecofruit , a division of the Basan Group, is one of the
world's leading producers of extra-fine green beans.^71 Founded in 1989, it works
with a network of 15,000 partner producers, processing and exporting vegetables
to European markets.^71
Madagascar Fruits Industries , based in Toamasina, is another key player in fruit
and vegetable transformation.^73
● Poultry & Livestock Feed: The SMTP Group is a leading diversified
conglomerate and a major producer of poultry and animal feed in Madagascar.
Through its subsidiaries like AGRIFARM and AGRIVAL, and supported by financing
from the IFC and GAFSP, it has expanded its production of day-old chicks and
animal feed, and operates a modern slaughterhouse.^74
● Aquaculture: Royal Tilapia is a professional aquaculture company that emerged
from an FAO-supported pilot. It operates a cage fish farming facility, partnering
with 40 cooperative associations to whom it provides fingerlings and feed,
creating an inclusive business model.^37
```
The structure of Madagascar's agricultural economy reveals a significant gap

between the millions of smallholder farmers and the large, often foreign-linked, export

firms. This "missing middle" limits the potential for broad-based value creation and

economic development. However, a new model is emerging to fill this void: the social

enterprise. Organizations like **Sahanala** exemplify this approach. It is structured as a

commercial company but is explicitly owned by the farmers and fishers who are its


main shareholders.^44 This hybrid structure allows it to pursue a dual mission:

generating profit while ensuring that value is returned to the producer communities.

This model is proving attractive to development finance institutions like the European

Investment Bank, which are able to provide large-scale investment capital that might

not be available to traditional NGOs or purely commercial ventures.^43 This suggests

that the most promising pathway for scaling up Malagasy agribusiness may lie in

these hybrid models that blend commercial discipline with a clear social and

developmental mandate.

**Logistics, Transport, and B2B Marketplaces**

An efficient supply chain is critical for the agricultural sector. Key logistics providers

include **Africa Global Logistics (AGL)** , which offers multimodal transport, customs

services, and contract logistics across 8 offices in Madagascar 75 , and

**TLT Transport et Logistique** , which provides national and international transport,

customs brokerage, and warehousing.^76 In the digital space, new B2B e-commerce

platforms are emerging to connect producers and buyers more efficiently. These

include

**E-Vokatra** , a national platform for online sales and exchange developed by the

Ministry of Agriculture and producer organizations 77 , and

**Vania** , a platform launched by Madagascar Business Magazine (MBM) to connect

farmers and suppliers.^78

**Professional Federations, Chambers, and Think-Tanks**

A robust network of business associations supports the private sector by providing

advocacy, networking, and trade facilitation services.

```
● Chambers of Commerce: The Fédération des Chambres de Commerce et
d'Industrie de Madagascar (FCCIM) is the national umbrella body for the 24
regional chambers.^79 The

## Part VI: The Innovation, Education, and Investment Ecosystem

The ecosystem for innovation, training, and investment in Madagascar's agricultural

sector is in an early stage of development. While foundational elements exist in

academia and a nascent tech scene, the critical links between technology, finance,

and agriculture are still being forged.

**AgriTech, FoodTech, & ClimateTech Innovators**

Madagascar's technology startup scene is young and, to date, has had limited direct

engagement with the agricultural sector.^87 The ecosystem is best represented in

sectors like Energy & Environment and Marketing, with a notable absence of a critical

mass of dedicated AgriTech or FoodTech ventures.^90 This gap highlights a significant

opportunity for innovation. Recognizing this, the government has initiated a major

top-down effort to inject advanced technology into the sector through a landmark

$90 million partnership with the Israeli firm

**LR Group Ltd**. This project aims to develop a 10,000-hectare smart farming hub


focused on rice, maize, and soybeans, utilizing solar-powered irrigation, high-yield

hybrid seeds, and AI-supported crop monitoring.^91

Despite the nascent stage of the ecosystem, several local innovators are active:

```
● Drone for Development (D4D): A startup that uses drones for agricultural land
analysis, environmental monitoring, and forestry.^93
● Malakass: A company focused on modernizing the cassava value chain in the
Atsimo-Andrefana region by transforming cassava into high-quality organic and
fair-trade flour.^93
● Mad'Arom: An enterprise that cultivates unique aromatic plants with small-scale
producers, providing training in agroforestry and producing essential oils for
export.^94
● Jirogasy: A ClimateTech startup that designs and manufactures solar home
systems and communication solutions, addressing the critical challenge of energy
access in rural areas where most agricultural activity takes place.^63
```
**Academic, Training, and Incubation Bodies**

**Higher Education**

The primary public institution for high-level agricultural training is the **Ecole**

**Supérieure des Sciences Agronomiques (ESSA)** at the University of Antananarivo.

Founded in 1963, it is the only public institution training agricultural engineers in the

country. It offers specializations in Tropical Agriculture and Sustainable Development;

Agroecology, Biodiversity and Climate Change; Agro-Management; Forestry and

Environment; Agricultural and Food Industries; and Animal Sciences.^5

**Incubators & Accelerators**

A small but growing number of hubs support the broader startup ecosystem, with


some engaging with agriculture-related ventures.

```
● Habaka: Established in 2011, Habaka is Madagascar's first innovation hub. It
provides co-working space, technical training (including CoderDojo for youth),
and incubation services. It has supported approximately 80 startups and is a key
node in the local tech community.^102
● Zafy Tody: A tech incubator and business angel founded in 2019, Zafy Tody
offers a unique model of equity-free funding and a 12-month incubation program
for 5 to 10 selected Malagasy startups annually. Its 2023 cohort included
NextFoodAfrica , demonstrating a direct link to the food sector.^108
● Orange Fab Madagascar: The corporate accelerator of Orange Madagascar, it
supports startups with high social impact. Its first cohort included Greentsika , a
digital waste collection solution with environmental impact, and VanillaPay , a
mobile payment processor crucial for e-commerce.^108
```
**The Investment Landscape**

The investment ecosystem for early-stage ventures in Madagascar is emerging, with a

mix of local impact funds and pan-African venture capital firms.

```
● Impact Investment Funds: Miarakap is the first impact investment company
dedicated to financing SMEs in Madagascar. Supported by international partners
like Investisseurs & Partenaires (I&P) and local institutions like Axian and Société
Générale, its portfolio includes agribusinesses such as Malakass (cassava) and
Exa (agro-industry).^115 The
Fondation pour les Aires Protégées et la Biodiversité de Madagascar
(FAPBM) also engages in impact investing, recently investing in Miarakap to
generate returns for conservation financing.^117
● Venture Capital & Pan-African Funds: Several pan-African VC funds include
Madagascar in their investment mandate, though dedicated deals remain rare.
These include Seedstars Africa Ventures , AfricInvest , and the FMO Ventures
Programme.^118
● Angel Networks: Madagascar Business Angels is the primary formal network
for angel investors in the country. It is affiliated with the African Business Angel
Network (ABAN) , which works to build investor capacity and mobilize capital
across the continent.^119
```

## Part VII: Quality Assurance, Standards, and Sectoral Events

The framework for quality control, certification, and industry promotion is a critical

component of the agricultural ecosystem, enabling market access and fostering

collaboration among stakeholders.

**Certification Bodies and Laboratories**

```
● National Standards Body: The Bureau des Normes de Madagascar (BNM) is
the official national standards body.^121 Its missions include developing national
Malagasy standards (NMG), coordinating all standardization work in the country,
promoting the application of standards, and representing Madagascar at
international organizations like the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO).^122 The BNM also manages the national NMG conformity mark and provides
training and certification services.^123 Its official website is http://www.bnm.mg.^121
● Key Testing Laboratories: A network of specialized laboratories ensures
compliance with national and international standards. The Laboratoire National
des Travaux Publics et du Bâtiment (LNTPB) , established in 1954, is crucial for
certifying construction and road materials used in agricultural infrastructure
projects.^121 Other important laboratories include those under the
National Center of Research for the Environment (CNRE) for environmental
analysis and the National Institute and Laboratory of Nuclear Sciences and
Technology (INSTN) for controlling radioactivity and heavy metal presence in
food products.^121
● International Certification: Access to international markets, particularly for
high-value products like vanilla, coffee, and spices, often requires international
certifications. While global bodies like the Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade
International provide the standards, implementation and certification on the
ground are frequently facilitated by local partners or through development
projects. For example, the NGO AVSF works with producer cooperatives to
achieve Fair Trade certification for lychee and vanilla, enabling them to access
European markets and double their income.^57
```

**Major Events, Trade Fairs, and Competitions**

Sectoral events are vital platforms for networking, knowledge sharing, and showcasing

innovations.

```
● Foire Internationale de l'Agriculture (FIA): The FIA is Madagascar's premier
annual trade fair for agriculture, livestock, and fisheries. The event brings
together hundreds of exhibitors—from small producer cooperatives to large
agribusinesses, input suppliers, and government agencies—and attracts tens of
thousands of visitors.^130 It serves as a critical venue for business-to-business
meetings, policy discussions, and the introduction of new technologies and
products to the market. The fair is typically held at the Forello Expo park in
Tanjombato, Antananarivo. Over the years, it has been organized by event
agencies such as
Première Ligne and Madavision.^133
● Other Events: The FIA is often paired with the Festival International de la
Gastronomie (FIG) , an event that highlights the culinary transformation of
Malagasy agricultural products and creates synergies between producers and the
hospitality industry.^134 Research institutions like
CIRAD and FOFIFA are regular participants in the FIA, using the platform to
disseminate research findings, such as new high-yield rice varieties, to farmers
and other stakeholders.^136
```
## Conclusion

The agricultural ecosystem of Madagascar is a complex tapestry woven from the

threads of government policy, international aid, deeply rooted producer networks, and

an emerging private sector. Its foundation is the smallholder farmer, who operates

within a system defined by immense potential yet constrained by significant structural

and environmental challenges.

The analysis reveals that the sector's governance and operational reality are best

understood through the lens of a tripartite power structure: the **Government**


provides the strategic framework, **International Partners** supply the financial and

technical fuel, and national **Farmer Federations** and **NGOs** serve as the

indispensable engine for implementation. Success for any stakeholder hinges on the

ability to navigate and align with this interdependent "tripod."

Two critical levers for unlocking the sector's potential have been identified. First is the

resolution of the **land tenure crisis**. The government's recent prioritization of a

national land certification program is a monumental step toward addressing this

foundational bottleneck, which has historically stifled farmer investment and

productivity. Second is the growth of the **"missing middle"** through innovative

business models. Social enterprises like Sahanala, which are commercially oriented

but farmer-owned, demonstrate a viable pathway to aggregate smallholder

production, add value locally, and attract development-focused investment, bridging

the gap between subsistence farming and large-scale agribusiness.

While the innovation ecosystem, particularly in AgriTech and FoodTech, remains

nascent, its potential is significant. The challenge lies in connecting the burgeoning

tech talent in hubs like Habaka and Zafy Tody to the concrete problems faced by

farmers in the field. Top-down initiatives, such as the government's smart agriculture

partnership, may accelerate this process, but sustainable innovation will require a

more organic integration of technology with the needs and capacities of local

producers.

Ultimately, transforming Madagascar's agricultural sector from one of potential to one

of prosperity will require a concerted effort to strengthen each of these

interconnected pillars. This involves creating a stable and transparent policy

environment, ensuring that international support is aligned with national priorities and

local realities, empowering producer organizations to be effective economic actors,

and fostering an environment where both private investment and technological

innovation can thrive for the benefit of the millions who depend on the land.
