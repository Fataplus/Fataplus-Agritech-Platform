## Key Implementation Details

### Technical Architecture
The mobile app RAG implementation leverages:
- **React Native RAG Library**: Core framework for offline LLM functionality
- **ExecuTorch**: On-device model execution for efficient inference
- **SQLite Vector Store**: Persistent storage for agricultural knowledge base
- **Peer-to-Peer Sharing**: QR code-based knowledge distribution between users

### Core Features
1. **Local LLM Hosting**
   - Technicians can host their local LLM instance for sharing
   - QR code generation for easy connection setup
   - Hotspot connectivity for direct device communication

2. **Offline Inference**
   - On-device LLM processing using optimized models
   - Context-aware agricultural recommendations without internet
   - Low-latency responses for real-time assistance

3. **Knowledge Persistence**
   - SQLite-based vector store for offline knowledge retention
   - Chat session logging for traceability and future reference
   - Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored

4. **Peer-to-Peer Distribution**
   - QR code scanning for connecting to technician's LLM instance
   - WiFi P2P connectivity for direct data transfer
   - Decentralized knowledge sharing network

### Implementation Phases
1. **Core RAG Integration** (Week 17)
   - Integrate React Native RAG library
   - Implement offline LLM inference
   - Add SQLite vector store persistence
   - Create RAG service and chat interface

2. **Peer-to-Peer Sharing** (Week 18)
   - Implement QR code generation
   - Build hotspot connectivity functionality
   - Create connection interface
   - Implement chat session management

3. **Chat Traceability** (Week 19)
   - Add chat logging functionality
   - Implement local storage of chat sessions
   - Create sync mechanism for chat logs
   - Build chat history retrieval features

4. **Optimization and Testing** (Week 20)
   - Optimize for low-resource devices
   - Test offline functionality
   - Validate peer-to-peer sharing
   - Performance testing under various conditions

## Impact and Benefits

### Accessibility
- AI assistance available in areas with no internet connectivity
- Direct sharing of expertise from technicians to farmers
- Support for low-end devices common in rural Africa

### Knowledge Transfer
- Decentralized approach enables widespread adoption
- Logged conversations for quality assurance and training
- Context-aware agricultural recommendations without internet

### Scalability
- Peer-to-peer network reduces infrastructure requirements
- Modular architecture allows for feature expansion
- Resource-efficient implementation for rural deployment

## Success Metrics
- Farmers can access AI assistance offline
- Peer-to-peer sharing works reliably
- Chat sessions are properly logged and traceable
- App performs well on low-resource devices

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of the 17 tasks outlined in tasks.md
2. Complete core RAG integration in Week 17
3. Implement peer-to-peer sharing in Week 18
4. Add chat traceability features in Week 19
5. Optimize and test in Week 20
6. Validate with real users in rural Madagascar

These updates ensure that the Fataplus specification documents fully reflect the new mobile app RAG capabilities, providing a complete roadmap for implementation and deployment in rural African agricultural contexts.
