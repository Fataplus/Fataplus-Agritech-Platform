# Implementation Plan: Fataplus Design System

**Feature Branch**: `002-fataplus-design-system`  
**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**Status**: Draft  

---

## Overview

This implementation plan details the technical approach for building the Fataplus Design System, a comprehensive, culturally-aware design system for African agricultural technology. Building on the existing UI components and design foundation, this plan outlines the development phases, technical architecture, and delivery milestones.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Assets
- **UI Components**: Basic component library in `/web-frontend/src/components/ui/`
  - Button, Card, Input, Modal, Badge, Form components
  - Initial documentation in README.md
  - TypeScript definitions and Tailwind CSS styling
- **Design System Page**: Initial showcase at `/web-frontend/src/pages/fataplus-design.tsx`
- **Color System**: Agricultural color palette (primary green, earth tones, accent colors)
- **Technology Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Next.js 14

### Gaps Identified
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Missing interactive documentation platform
- **Agricultural Components**: Lack of agriculture-specific UI components
- **Cultural Adaptation**: No multi-language or cultural adaptation guidelines
- **Design Tokens**: Informal color system, missing structured design tokens
- **Testing Infrastructure**: No visual regression or accessibility testing
- **Component Playground**: No interactive testing environment
