# MVP Execution Plan

## Overview
**Session**: CLAUDE-001 | **Date**: 2025-09-19
**Project**: FP-09 Fataplus Agritech Platform MVP
**Timeline**: 8-10 weeks
**Scope**: 50 essential tasks (vs 167+ full scope)

## MVP Validation Results ✅

### Requirements Validation
- ✅ **Data Model**: Comprehensive 590-line schema with 25+ tables ready
- ✅ **API Contracts**: Users, Farms, Contexts contracts well-defined
- ✅ **Architecture**: Constitution compliance maintained with 4-project structure
- ✅ **Task Dependencies**: Critical path validated and parallel execution confirmed
- ✅ **Business Requirements**: Core agricultural functionality preserved

### Scope Reduction Justification
**MVP Focus**: Essential infrastructure, security, and basic functionality
- **Kept**: Infrastructure, security, core APIs, basic weather context
- **Deferred**: Advanced contexts, mobile app, AI services, complex analytics
